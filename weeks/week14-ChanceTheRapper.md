Near the beginning of *Hamilton*, in the song "Aaron Burr, Sir", many of the main characters are introducing themselves. One character does so by saying "Brah, brah, I am Hercules Mulligan". It is the "Brah, brah" that I want to single out here. In two simple non-words, Hercules Mulligan tells you just a little bit about himself. He's got some swag and he's a bit uncouth. He delivers these sounds with a deep voice, not far from how a larger dog might sound when it growls.

I bring this up because this week had a dark shadow lain upon it. Throughout every album (in what felt like a majority of the songs), by Chance the Rapper's equivalent of this sound. Sometimes it happens once or twice, and other times it happened 467 times (I counted<sup>1</sup>). Chance makes this yelp, a "eeyaaahhhh" sound, and it happens *a lot*. I'm not sure if he's trying to do his own version of some of the sounds Michael Jackson would make between lyrics sometimes, or if he's recording during karate practice, but it happens a lot. Unfortunately, Chance is the bichon frisé to Hercules Mulligan's bulldog, and I absolutely hated this sound. Without further ado, here is this week's playlist:

- *10 Day* (2012)
- *Acid Rap* (2013)
- *Surf* (Nico Segal, 2015)
- *Coloring Book* (2016)
- “The Man Who Has Everything” (2018)
- *The Big Day* (2019)
- *Star Line* (2025)

Let's go through these albums one by one.

*10 Day* Yelp Rating: ★★★☆☆

Thankfully, the yelp is not as pervasive yet as it will be in later albums. In fact, two of my favorite songs from this week are in the first four songs - "Nostalgia" and "Windows". "Family" and "Prom Night" have some solid beats, and the trumpet/drum machine combo in "Long Time II" works great. Not a groundbreaking album, but one that benefitted from a second playthrough, as I found myself liking some of the songs more on second listen.

*Acid Rap* Yelp Rating: ☆☆☆☆☆

This album. This gods damned album. The yelp-per-song rating is off the chart. There are things worth listening to in this album. "Paranoia" really grabbed me, until it shoved me away with yelps. "Cocoa Butter Kisses" has some great lyric interplay between the lines "burn holes in my hoodies" and "burn holes in my memories". "Everybody's Something" *almost* makes me like it in spite of the yelps. But there are just SO MANY YELPS. For the first time in this entire process, I almost Noped Out of an artist because of this album. Even jazz didn't do that to me. Go home album, I've got nothing for you. I eeyaaahhhh recommend that eeyaaahhhh no eeyaaahhhh one eeyaaahhhh listen to eeyaaahhhh this eeyaaahhhh album.

*Surf* Yelp Rating: ★★★☆☆

So, this album isn't all about Chance - it's technically Nico Segal's album, but it's a highly collaborative effort with Chance. And I think the best thing about it is clearly Nico said "cut it out with the yelps, Chance" - because the yelps barely make an appearance. I honestly wish there was a half star emoji, because this album deserves 3.5 stars, but I am beholden to the emoji, and 4 stars really feels like "will revisit again some day" - which I can't say I'll do for this album. The instrumentals are fantastic throughout, with "Something Came to Me" having some fantastic trumpet work (not shocking, since Nico has performed under the name "Donnie Trumpet"). "Sunday Candy" was a really good song, one I connected to more than any other song on the album. Jamila Woods brings the track to life with her voice, and honestly all of the instrumentals and vocals really meld well together.

*Coloring Book* Yelp Rating: ★★☆☆☆

This album deserved better, but the yelps killed it. First listen through, it again almost made me bail while listening to "No Problem"; and it's a shame, it's a pretty good song up until that point. "Summer Friends" is a solid song, and I really liked "Same Drugs". "Juke Jam" can claim the title of the best Justin Bieber song ever, clearing a *very low bar*. And "Mixtape" has an amazing beat, despite being let down in other areas. "How Great" has some really good lyrical work. But the yelps - they are everywhere. Almost every song has one, many songs have many, many more.

So why two stars? Because if you could remove all of the yelps from this album, I think I'd really like it. The backing tracks, throughout, have some amazing beats. The album kept pulling me in with the rhythm and beat of almost every song. It's too bad the yelps kept shoving me away, but I have to give credit for those beats, hence the two stars.

"The Man Who Has Everything" Yelp Rating: ★★★☆☆

Not a bad song, but not amazing either. It's solid, but doesn't really grab me. But I wasn't noticing the yelps, so it gets that third star.

*The Big Day* Yelp Rating: ★★★☆☆

I almost gave this album four stars. I really did. Definitely another album hurt by my mandate to use the available emoji to rate these albums. That and - perhaps because of how this week colored my feeling about Chance as a whole - I don't think I'll be revisiting this album, so it doesn't get the fourth star.

But this album does have some things that really work for me. "All Day Long" is a solid start to the album. "Do You Remember", "Get a Bag", and "Ballin Flossin" all have really great beats. "Roo" drew me in both times I listened to it. And "Sun Come Down" was one of my favorite songs of the week. "Do You Remember" drew me in (mostly because of Death Cab for Cutie's parts, which has me looking forward to week 32 of this project). Just like *Coloring Book*, if you could remove the (thankfully only handful of) yelps, I think I'd really like this album, because from start to finish the beats were fantastic. Even typing this, I almost want to give it a fourth star, but it *just* doesn't quite get there.

*STAR LINE* Yelp Rating: ★★★☆☆

This is a solid three stars - no half star waffling. Great beats throughout, but again, some things ruined by yelps. "Ride" is perhaps the perfect example of this - the first half of the song is legit great, I almost noted it as one of my favorites. And then the second half of the song happens, with its 5,437 yelps. And I hate every second of that second half. But between "Back To The Go" and "Space & Time", songs that were among my favorites this week, the highs were high enough to overcome a combination of yelps (go straight to hell, "Speed of Light", for all of your yelps) and a handful of songs that just didn't make me care about them.

So, one week and 525,600 yelps later, I've come to the end of a week that did not live up to what I thought it would. I've listened to an interview or two on NPR with Chance the Rapper. I saw him perform "Space & Time" on TV once. I knew that he was influenced to some degree by OutKast and George Clinton, two artists from former weeks that I really enjoyed. And yet, Chance the Rapper did not work out for me. Perhaps in another universe, where he never learned to yelp, I would have a different feeling. But as it is, I can't see myself really revisiting any of this.

- Favorite Album: *Big Day* gets this, because more than any album, I felt like it was the most *almost there*. I genuinely liked a lot of the songs, and for my money, it had the best beats of all the albums.
- Favorite Song: "Same Drugs" wins by a very small margin, in one of those decisions where I felt different 30 minutes ago, and will feel different in another 30 minutes. "Nostalgia", "Windows", "Sunday Candy", "Sun Come Down", "Back To The Go", and "Space & Time" all were in the running. I couldn't help but notice that most of these songs are more emotional, more mellow - honestly, I'd really enjoy an entire Chance the Rapper album full of songs like these. For as much as did enjoy many of the beats/backing tracks he produced on most of his work, these were the songs that made me feel more connected to the music as a whole.

Here's to hoping that next week goes better when I, as far as I know, listen to Deep Purple for the first time ever.
