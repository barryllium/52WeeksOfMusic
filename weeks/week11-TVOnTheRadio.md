I was worried Jazz had broken me coming into this week, simply because of how things started when I began this week's playlist, which includes every TV on the Radio album, plus a bonus single:

- "Young Liars" (2003)
- *Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes* (2004)
- *Return to Cookie Mountain* (2006)
- *Dear Science* (2008)
- *Nine Types of Light* (2011)
- *Seeds* (2014)

"Young Liars" came on, and I immediately felt saved from a world devoid of lyrics, a world where the next note might have no connection to the previous note, a world where sometimes I was listening to 2, 3, or 7 songs at the same time. I knew, immediately, that I was going to love every non-Jazz song I heard for the rest of my life.

And then I kept listening.

Songs fell flat. I started worrying that I hit a temporary high with "Young Liars", but then I was ruined for all music *because of Jazz*. Perhaps I had built up walls to protect me from Jazz that I then needed to tear back down, because this music wasn't reaching me like I desperately wanted it to. I felt myself over-analyzing what I was hearing, trying to figure out why it wasn't reaching me. I was way too much in my head; I simply wasnâ€™t experiencing the music, and it made me a little sad.

So, I found myself listening to all of *Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes*, *Return to Cookie Mountain*, *Dear Science*, and barely made any notes. Which is weird - usually I have lots of notes the first time I listen through to a playlist. It was almost like I wasn't really even listening to the music.

And then, *Nine Types of Light* made me listen - and something clicked for me. That's what I really want here with this project. Sure, I want to broaden my horizons, expand my experience, and delve into worlds of music that have not been my comfort zone for the past 46 years. What I want is to find more music that says "I don't care what you are doing right now, you *will* listen to me."

Thankfully, given the small discography of TV on the Radio, I was left with enough time to listen to everything three times. So once *Nine Types of Light* woke me up, it was like I could treat my first playthrough like a palette cleanser, a practice run. With that said, I'm going to start back at the top.

I legit like "Young Liars" - which was a relief, it wasn't just Jazz that made me like it. In fact, it was one of my favorite songs I listened to this week, and it continues a trend of me finding the early work of some of the artists I'm exploring being some of my favorite new music I'm discovering. And that continued into *Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes* - which, by the third time I listened to it, challenged for my favorite album of the week. There are some standout songs on there - "Staring at the Sun", "Don't Love You", and "You Could Be Love" all stood out to me in different ways, and when I finished my third run through the discography, I listened to all three again as I tried to figure out what my favorite TV on the Radio song was from this week.

*Return to Cookie Mountain* did not, however, inspire the same feelings in me. I almost want to give it a *fourth* listen, because of how much other albums grew on me over time, but it just didn't catch me, didn't make me listen to it. It's hard to think of songs that stood out, it took looking at the track listing right now to remember that "Wash the Day Away" was a song I kinda liked. I don't know why, either. In my initial notes, I wrote that I really liked the overall vibe, but nothing was blowing me away. Through three listens, I still feel the same way.

And that brings up an interesting conclusion I came to this week: every song has "good bones". The backing music was almost always great, felt original, and had a nice groove to it. The vocals were always interesting in how they played with tone, harmonies, and using a voice like another instrument. But somehow, some songs put the pieces together in a way that really worked for me, and others just didn't pull it off. I guess that's art, and it's super subjective, but for some reason I felt that juxtaposition more with TV on the Radio than with most bands.

*Dear Science* got better for me each time I listened to it. The first time through, while it didn't grab me a ton, it still felt like a step up from *Return to Cookie Mountain*. But by the end, "Lover's Day" had worked its way into my top songs for the week, and I really liked "Family Tree" and "Gray Skies" as well. Solid album, but it just couldn't stand up to...

*Nine Types of Light*. This is a great album, and as I type this, I kinda just want to listen to it again. "Keep Your Heart" and "You" are early album winners, "Caffeinated Consciousness" is a really good late album song, but the heart of this album is what really does it for me. The back-to-back-to-back songs of "Killer Crane", "Will Do", and "New Cannonball Blues" are where it's at. All of those songs made the "fav song runoff" at the end. All of them were noted several times in my notes. I just want to listen to these songs again. They felt familiar and new all at the same time, every time.

I wish I had more to say about their final album, *Seeds*, but I really don't. It felt a bit like a letdown after *Nine Types of Light*, which was honestly a hard act to follow. It's not like there aren't good songs - I especially enjoyed "Careful You" and "Right Now" - but the album as a whole felt like they were *trying* to make a different vibe with this album, and it just didn't hit for me the way *Nine Types of Light* or even *Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes* did.

It was great to have a week where I wasn't simply trying to run out the clock and finish listening to things - despite the journey this week took me on, I overall enjoyed listening to everything. Like I said before, these songs all have good bones, so even the songs that didn't individually wow me still gave me some enjoyment. Even "weird" songs like "Ambulance", which delved into a cappella, still had things I really liked about them (in fact, I think I would have loved "Ambulance" if it hadn't been a cappella). And there was one mystery I kept trying to unravel all week - who does TV on the Radio remind me of?

This took several forms. There were songs that made me think of The Pixies ("You Could Be Love"), songs that made me think of Prince (a few near the end of *Dear Science*), songs that made me think of the Foo Fighters ("Could You"). Other songs made me think of George Clinton, OutKast, or Mumford & Sons. Many songs made me think of Imagine Dragons, especially the bass and backing music work. There was even one song ("I Was a Lover") that I felt like could be a Panic? at the Disco song (they have not earned the exclamation mark with me ðŸ˜ƒ). At some points, I felt like Tunde Adebimpe's voice sounded a bit like Chris Martin, at other points he sounded like Black Francis. But, finally, on my third listening, "Dancing Choose" unlocked it for me: especially when rapping, he sounds like Lin-Manuel Miranda. My brain was so damn happy to unravel this mystery.

As I continued to reflect on how often they reminded me of other artists â€” some they followed, others they pre-dated â€” I feel like I discovered some of the magic that others find in TV on the Radio. Even though from song to song they would remind me (or even sound like) another artist, they still always sounded like themselves. They had their own twist, their own flavor, their own artistry that stood out. That realization made me appreciate them even more.

- Favorite album - I feel like I spoiled this, perhaps? OK, yeah, I definitely spoiled it. It's *Nine Types of Light*. But I have to give credit to *Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes* for giving it a run for its money by the time I was through.
- Favorite song - this is a tough one, because there are a handful of songs that I really liked. But I have to hand it to "New Cannonball Blues", because it stood out every time I listened to it. Something about it just gives it the edge over "Killer Crane", "Will Do", "Lover's Day", "You Could Be Love", "Don't Love You", and "Young Liars" - songs that all keep bubbling back up to the top for me.

What a week. I can't say that I love everything that TV on the Radio did, especially when I could so easily forget about two of their five albums. But, two of their five albums also *really* worked for me. I'm not sure I've had an artist quite cover the gamut like they did.

And now, next week, onto something entirely different, a band that essentially invented a genre: Black Sabbath
