Welcome to another week of “What songs will make Brett cry?”! I’m your host, Brett, a middle-aged former robot that has been broken down by life and is now able to access [feelings](https://youtu.be/tTJ22CSgxqI?t=60). And here are this week’s contestants:

- *A.M.* (1995)
  - First Listen: “Box Full of Letters,” “Passenger Side”
  - Second Listen: Entire album
- *Being There* (1996)
- *Summerteeth* (1999)
- *Yankee Hotel Foxtrot* (2002)
- *A Ghost Is Born* (2004)
  - First Listen: “Handshake Drugs,” “Theologians”
  - Second Listen: Entire album
- *Sky Blue Sky* (2007)

Over the summer, I listened to [an interview with Jeff Tweedy](https://songexploder.net/jeff-tweedy), and thought the guy sounded interesting. I had heard of Wilco, but knew nothing else about them, so that got them on the list.

Only listening to two songs from *A.M.* got things off to a good start; “Box Full of Letters” gave me a little bit of vibe from Stroke 9’s *Nasty Little Thoughts* (maybe it’s because “Letters” is one of my favorite songs on that album and the song names are similar, or maybe the vibe was really there), and “Passenger Side” kept making me think of Bob Dylan. An artist surely could find worse artists to invoke. 

Based on these songs, I decided to listen to this entire album the second time around, and found one of my favorite songs of the week. Sometimes I can’t quantify why I like a song, but in the end, “Should’ve Been In Love” is really just catchy as hell for me. Maybe it’s the guitar work, or the rhythm, I don’t really know, but it just works for me. “Casino Queen” and “Pick Up the Change” both had some guitar playing that I really liked, and “Blue Eyed Soul” did a great job of melding the acoustic and electric guitar in a way that I liked.

Then I got to *Being There*, where we get our first winner of the week. In “Sunken Treasure”, the combination of the way Jeff Tweedy inflects his voice when he sings “I am so out of tune with you”, along with the solemnness of the background music really got to me, and — you guessed it — made me cry. I started the song over, and listened to the lyrics more. You can really feel the pain, and possibly even shame, in those lines - and it hit me in the heart.

I really liked this album as a whole. “Misunderstood” is a strong start to the album, somehow feeling both emotional and detached at the same time to me, which felt like an accomplishment. With that said, it starts a trend of songs where the song goes on just a bit too long at the end - songs where I wish they would have ended 30 seconds (or sometimes seven minutes) earlier.

“Monday” has a great rhythm, and the horns are a nice touch. “What’s the World Got in Store” made me appreciate Tweedy’s voice more, and the organ is great (if Deep Purple week taught me anything, apparently I love some good keyboard/organ). “Say You Miss Me” is heartfelt and catchy, and was another favorite this week. I could shout out a few other songs on this album, but overall I’ll just say this was a strong album.

I will bring up one more song from *Being There*, though. “Forget the Flowers” was my first real test of something that usually makes songs bounce right off of me - the banjo. I don’t listen to a lot of songs that have the banjo, but usually it does not go well. Insert _every_ Mumford & Sons song here: without fail, I will be enjoying the song, and then the banjo happens to me, and I’m out. It just takes me to a different place than where I was in the song, and it kills it for me. Not so with Wilco (props to Max Johnston and his banjo-ing) - I don’t know if it’s how they tactically deploy the banjo, or if it’s the fact that it’s also accompanied by several other instruments. So, Wilco wins the non-existent banjo wars, I guess.

As we get into *Summerteeth*, “Can’t Stand It” brings me to yet another aside. How many artists can one band make me think of? I’ve already mentioned Bob Dylan and Stroke 9, but _both_ times through in my notes I wrote “[this song] has strong Coldplay vibes”. Later in this album, we get to “I’m Always in Love” and “Candyfloss” which both made me think of Weezer. And there are a few songs on various albums that remind me of Sondre Lerche (who I only know from the soundtrack of *Dan in Real Life*). Sometimes it’s the way Tweedy’s voice sounds, other times it’s the musical arrangement, but it was uncanny how quickly my brain identified the link between Wilco and the other artists on those songs.

This is another strong album, with great rhythms throughout. But if I’m being honest (apparently, I’m not honest often enough that I need to qualify this), this album comes down to two songs: “A Shot in the Arm” and “My Darling”.  Once the lyrics got through to me in “A Shot in the Arm”, that’s what really made it stand out. For whatever reason, I loved the line “We fell in love in the key of C, we walked along down by the sea”. I’m not even completely sure what the meaning really is there, but I still liked it. Overall, though, the idea of standing by someone as they are changing over time was one that resonated with me.

And then we get back to “My Darling”, our second winner of the week. A simple and sweet song about having children, wanting to protect them, and watching them grow up un-shockingly got to me, especially now that my babies are growing up and doing things like going off to college. I’m not crying, you’re crying.

Next up on the playlist was *Yankee Hotel Foxtrot*, and I of course must point out the how well the guitar and keyboard work together in “Heavy Metal Drummer” due to my newfound love of the keyboard. Another strong album, with another of my favorite 1.5 songs of the week in “Radio Cure” and the first half of “Reservations”. I could really feel the pain in “Radio Cure”, and I really connected with the chorus, the idea of feeling like there is something wrong with me because my mind is occupied by something that I wish it wasn’t. Oh, but the first half of “Reservations”… how I wish this was only a 4 minute song, because it just goes on 7 minutes too long. But I will just co-sign the lyrics “I’ve got reservations about so many things, but not about you”. I feel this way about a handful of people, and almost all of them live in my house with me, and I love them to no end.

I wish I had more to say about *A Ghost Is Born*, but this album was a bit of a letdown for me. I just didn’t connect with any of the songs the way I did on Wilco’s other albums. Some songs like “Handshake Drugs” and “Less Than You Think” had promise, but either went on too long or just had some weirdness in it that broke the song for me, and other songs just didn’t have anything in it that gripped me like songs on other albums did.
Thankfully, *Sky Blue Sky* starts out with “Either Way”, which felt like a better song than any song on *A Ghost Is Born*, and it wasn’t even my favorite song on the album. While I liked the vibe of this entire album, the songs that got me the most were “Please Be Patient With Me” and “On and On and On”. As I’m realizing is a common theme with me, if you want to write a song about how you have trouble connecting with people sometimes (because of your trauma, past, shame, or whatever), chances are that I’m going to like your song. And “Please Be Patient With Me” hits the mark on that big time. I texted it to my wife and wrote “I think I wrote that song somehow”, so I’ll be waiting by the mailbox waiting for my royalty check, I guess. And “On and On and On” really embraces the uncertainty of life (along with the certainty of life ending) and finds a way to make a simple and sweet song about loving someone forever through it all. And I loved the song for doing that.

A week with Wilco, and I once again come out a fan. It was a tough compare, too - because I came off last week feeling like I loved every single Tracy Chapman song, and feeling like she sings a masterclass in putting emotion into songs. And then, one of the things I loved most about Wilco was how they could create an emotional atmosphere with their lyrics, vocals, and music. It took me a little bit to stop comparing the two artists - but once I did, I really did enjoy most of Wilco’s work. While I don’t end this week feeling like I loved _everything_, the highs were really high, with songs and albums I feel like I will come back to some day.

- Favorite Album: this was somehow difficult and easy for me. I immediately felt like *Being There* was my favorite album, and then I think of *Summerteeth* or *Sky Blue Sky*, and for a few seconds think I’m wrong… but then I come back to *Being There*.  It maybe doesn’t have the highest highs, but it felt the most consistent to me, and does have some songs like “Say You Miss Me” and “Sunken Treasure” that I really like
- Favorite Song: this is more difficult for me, and it almost has a “what song did I listen to last” feel to it… and so it does go to the last song that I listened to. “On and On and On” does it for me, I love the song and it makes me feel so grateful for everything that I have in my life. Perhaps if “Reservations” was 5 minutes shorter it might get this spot (it’s been stuck in my head for days), but I just can’t forgive the 7 minute instrumental at the end. So “On and On and On” it is.

Next up, Jack White
