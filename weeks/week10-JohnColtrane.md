[You’re not stupid, Jazz is stupid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMcqKyfnT2Y)

I was *very* worried entering this week that I would not be one of my more enjoyable weeks. But, here we are, after a week of listening to John Coltrane... and I was right.

Honestly, for the first few days, I kept questioning my reality:

- Am I in an elevator, or a hotel lobby?
- Should I be playing Jazz Flute right now?
- Am I about to get involved in some crazy capers while moving at 2x speed in a black and white movie with my witless colleagues?

I had no clue how I would pick a favorite song, I honestly wasn't even sure when one song ended and another began if I wasn't watching the playlist go by. Favorite album? Even harder, if they are all the same song, are they all the same album?

And further, was John Coltrane good? I mean, I'm told he was good. He apparently influenced generations of musicians with his harmonies and improvisation. But all I know is that I didn't enjoy a lot of this, and at times it sounded more like [loud noises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMSMk1BeslA) than music to me. So, without further ado, the playlist - and for the first time so far, I added nothing in a phase 2:

- *Blue Train* (1958)
- *Giant Steps* (1960)
- *My Favorite Things* (1961)
- *Olé Coltrane* (1961)
- *Live! at the Village Vanguard* (1962)
- *A Love Supreme* (1965)
- *Ascension* (1966)

I really tried to give this all a fair shot. I listened to a lot of it while it had my full attention, and I just could not get into it, especially in my first run through. In fact, I was driving while listening to *Blue Train* for the first time, when I saw a sign for a live jazz concert happening that night, and all I could think was "hard pass."

The journey through was beyond interesting. In my first listen, I found myself start to warm up to it a little bit, and then disliking it more and more as I hit the last few albums. At one point, I even asked whether I even liked the saxophone at all.

But, then, as I started listening to *Blue Train*, Stockholm Syndrome apparently got to me. I found myself tapping my feet and nodding my head, at which point I gave that album a rating of "not bad!". More than anything, this was a big relief, because there is a lot of smooth saxophone playing in *Blue Train*, so I felt like it wasn't that I didn't like the saxophone. And thank goodness, because if I learned anything growing up as a teenager during the Clinton administration, it's that the saxophone is cool. Luckily, that's the main thing I learned from that administration 😅

Still, though, this is an overall "thumbs down" from me. Yes, there were moments in songs that I really enjoyed. The drum solo in "Summertime" is legit, and gets even better when the piano joins in. The beginning of "My Favorite Things" is catchy (helped by the fact that it's a tune I know), but the second half felt like an unmitigated disaster - whatever the opposite of a joyride is (A woehaul? Chaoscruise? YouDiedOfDysenteryDrive?). Every few songs there would be 30 seconds here and there where I'd start to get into it, but I just could not stay there.

Oh, and a big question - how are all these albums under just the name "John Coltrane", when half of the songs are "John Coltrane stands around while other musicians play music"? And half the time, those other musicians were my favorite part of the songs! And yes, I know he composed some of the music - but other songs he was not the composer, and yet he didn't do anything for half of the songs. I know he has other albums under the "John Coltrane Quartet" (*Live! at the Village Vanguard* was one of those, actually), and there it makes sense. But if you're going to only perform for half of an album, that you didn't even compose, have the decency to credit the other people on the album cover, dammit.

And don't get me started on when Coltrane teases us with lyrics by chanting "A Love Supreme" a dozen times during "A Love Supreme, Pt. 1: Acknowledgement". That's not lyrics, you know I wanted lyrics, and you gave me a repeated phrase. I was actively mad listening to that.

OK, so at this point, I've been rather down on Coltrane. For a change of pace, I'm... going to post my live notes of listening to *Ascension*. I can't say for sure that this is essentially a live history of how this album was recorded, but I also can't say for sure that it's *not that*!

> The beginning of Ascension sounds like a bad high school band warming up
>
> Around the 10 minute mark, it transitions into that moment that I can only assumed happens in every high school music class at some point — the teacher hasn’t shown up, and everyone trades instruments and starts seeing what they can do with each others’ instruments. This is the only explanation for what is happening.
>
> That lasts for about five minutes, before everyone else quiets down a bit, because it turns out whoever has the trumpet at that point is actually pretty good.
>
> But as Edition I, Part I ends, everyone else decides to pick their instruments back up again, just to see if they all sound good together at the same time now. Spoiler: they don’t.
>
> Edition I, part II starts out with the original trumpet player getting their instrument back, and discovering that the other player has played a trick on him: he’s stuck an object, possibly a small woodland creature, in his trumpet! Not to be deterred, he fights on, performing the Herculean task of cleaning his instrument while playing it. Around two minutes in, it finally becomes dislodged, only to get stuck again for a bit. But with a mighty blow, he completely dislodges the animal, and many more horns blow in triumph.
>
> Around four minutes in, Coltrane remembers that it’s his name on the album, and realizes he should probably pick up his sax and play for a while. I mean, there are four other people playing sax on this song, but I’m going to assume that’s him playing.
>
> And, at six minutes in, they all decide to play at once, but just not the same song. So Coltrane's definitely somewhere in there.
>
> It’s at this moment I see that Coltrane is credited with “composition and lyrics" on this album. Looks like he fell asleep at the job on at least one of these tasks, since not a word has been spoken in the first 25 minutes of the album.
>
> Around 10 minutes in, I now have realized that they are performing in a moving vehicle, as they are clearly in a traffic jam and people are mashing their horns. Thankfully that only lasts for about 30 seconds, before we get some delightful piano work for a bit. Honestly, for the most part, the piano, bass and drums are working together quite well.
>
> At the 13 minute mark, though, we are interrupted as someone realized they needed to tune their bass. Thankfully they get it together after 20-30 seconds and do a fairly decent job of pulling it together and doing some pretty dope staccato work (is that the right word?) for a few minutes.
>
> Then the drummer steps in for a bit, and things go well… until - and I can only assume this is exactly what happened - someone opened up the soundproof booth that all the horns were locked in, and they all start blaring at once. At a deep listen, it seems like each of them are actually playing well individually, but they have the problem that they are not, however, playing individually.
>
> With about two minutes left, everyone has hit the musical equivalent of the Apple Fitness+ burn bar, and are giving it their all. And it’s a good thing, because it makes me realize something: my problem is that there are often one-to-five too many instruments playing at any given time. Any time some instruments are taking a break, I actually kind of like the pared down work. But then an instrument or twelve come in and mess with that for me.

And now we start Edition II, and I had to do some research. I will apparently be treated to a slightly different arrangement of the same song as Edition I, just different recording dates. ChatGPT informs me of the following:

> Edition I is considered rougher and more chaotic, with looser transitions and rawer energy.
>
> Edition II is slightly more organized and balanced, with clearer solo order and somewhat less density.

Rougher and more chaotic - Edition I sure lived up to that. Let’s see how Edition II goes…

> Really glad they still included their warmup in Edition II. You can tell they’ve practiced a bit. But still needs work, a bit all over the place still.
>
> I can in no way verify that this is less chaotic 5 minutes in.
>
> Good news - the teacher must be there, because I don’t think they switched instruments this time around! I mean, they are all playing at once again, and there are anywhere from three to seven different songs happening, but they do seem to be doing this on purpose for some reason.
>
> About 12.5 minutes in, we have some serious sax work, so I’m assuming that’s Coltrane again. It does sound a bit like he’s shoved the mic inside the sax at times, though.
>
> Grade-A trumpet work again around 16 minutes in. Works great with the drums/bass backing.
>
> With a minute left, though, the Apple Fitness+ burn bar kicks in again, and they all play their hearts out. Not a compliment.
>
> Part II kicks in, and the musicians show constraint… for a minute. And then they all go for it again. Luckily, it appears that we have had no trickery with the trumpet this time around. Shit, that may have even been a sax last time, because it seems to be this time. I don’t know if it says more about me or the music that I’m not sure.
>
> Definitely sax from minute three, until everyone else starts to play again about 5.5 minutes in.
>
> Luckily, that only lasts for a minute, before we are back to sax, bass and drums. This works for a minute, until it kind of doesn’t. Why can’t they just play the right notes?
>
> 8.5 minutes in, we are again “treated” to all the instruments. I do think they are mainly playing the same song this time, though.
>
> Good news - it seems we avoided the traffic jam. Bad news, I think some donkeys are dying while the sax players are all playing all out at once.
>
> Thank the gods, a bit past 11 minutes and I’m treated to the piano/bass/drums mix I liked the first time around. These guys get it.
>
> Dammit, that guy forgot to tune his bass again. But after that he gets to it again, and is overall enjoyable.
>
> In sad news, the drummer only gets about 10-15 seconds to kick in before the door to the horns room is open again. No one is leaving anything on the field this time, they are all really going for it. I will give Edition II this, though, for the most part I think there are less total songs going on now, at least.
>
> With a little less than three minutes left in the song, it seems the sax players push everyone out of the way so they can all be right at the microphone. After about thirty seconds they seemingly (and correctly) seem to regret this decision and back off, letting everyone else play again.
>
> In true Nick Bottom fashion, the song spends the last 1.5 minutes ending, only to repeatedly not end. The musicians seem to be playing a “fun” game of “You hang up. No, you hang up! No, you!”. Eventually, they all hang up.

With both editions done, I guess I agree with ChatGPT - Edition II felt more refined (less unrefined?), and a bit less chaotic. But I didn’t need to hear that twice. I'm sure jazz aficionados will heartily disagree, but this is a bad album. It's closer to "noises from a crowded city" than music to me.

And yet, here we are, at the end of the week, and I'm forced (by me, I guess) to pick some favorites:

- Favorite song: Can I pick the piano/bass/drums portion of Ascension (either edition) Part II? In all seriousness, "Everytime We Say Goodbye" is a sweetly simple, smooth song that I found myself enjoying. In all of the noise, this somehow became an easy pick.
- Favorite album: *Blue Train* wins it. It's not a perfect album, but unlike the other albums it didn't actively upset me, and I found myself getting into it.

Next up, something (thankfully) different... TV on the Radio
