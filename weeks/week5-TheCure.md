"I wonder what it would be like to have been listening to *The Cure* for the past 40 years"

That's what I kept wondering repeatedly this week. Well, amongst other things - it's been a week. Cars breaking down, people physically breaking down, me repeatedly almost mentally breaking down. Let's just say I couldn't have handled *The Kinks* this week. But as I listened to *The Cure* this week, I could feel their evolution, and I could picture myself listening to these albums multiple times, and then a few years later, getting a new album from them, and enjoying it even more.

I definitely benefited from multiple listens this week - with almost every album I wrote something akin to "I really appreciated this album more the second time around". *Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me* was a major winner here; on first listen felt much weaker to me, but the second time through I identified several stand out songs for me ("Kiss Me", "Just Like Heaven", "Catch", and "Why Can't I Be You", in particular), and really got into the album as a whole.

My initial playlist was this:

* “Boys Don’t Cry”
* *Seventeen Seconds*
* *Faith*
* *Pornography*
* *The Head on the Door*
* *Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me*
* *Disintegration*
* *Wish*

Right off the bat, I had a "today I learned" moment. I've been listening to "Boys Don't Cry" for years... only I thought it was an *Oleander* song. And I like the *Oleander* version (and I think I still prefer it), but little did I know it was originally by *The Cure*. Nonetheless, a fun intro to The Cure that made me feel a little familiarity instantly.

For *Seventeen Seconds* and *Faith*, I really felt like they leaned into instrumentals more than lyrics, which ended up working for me more the second time through than the first time. I felt like I was waiting for lyrics for the songs to "take off" for me. But during the second listen, I was very impressed by the bass work on *Faith* as a whole, and found a few songs that stood out for me in "Play For Today", "Secrets" (though I wish it was shorter and less repetitive), "The Holy Hour", and "Other Voices".

Immediately after finishing *Pornography* for the first time, I wrote a note about wondering how I will feel about it after another listen. I didn't dislike the album, but nothing stood out to me. After my second listen, I can't say it worked for me much more though - I felt like many of the songs stayed "one note" for too long, like they were setting something up that they never built up to.

On my second listen, I added *Japanese Whispers* and *The Top* in after *Pornography* (I'll get to why in a second). I preferred *Japanese Whispers* to *Pornography*, with "The Upstairs Room" being a standout for me. But I liked *The Top* even more. Again, not a lot of standout songs ("Birdmad Girl" worked for me) - but I felt more in tune with the album as a whole and look forward to listening to it again at some point.

*The Head on the Door* is where things peaked for me. Both times through, it was my favorite album - and it was the reason I added in some albums on my second listen (thanks to recommendations from my partner in all of this, ChatGPT). "In Between Days" sets the mood instantly, and the album delivers until the end. Knowing what little I know of *The Cure* heading into this (which was "Friday I'm in Love" and "Lovesong"), this was the version of *The Cure* I was expecting and hoping for, this is what I hoped every album would be like - which is somewhat ironic, since neither song I knew is on this album. But between "In Between Days", "The Blood", and "Close to Me", I found some standout songs and a vibe that I really enjoyed from start to finish.

*Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me* is the perfect example of an album that I needed the second listen for. "Just Like Heaven" stuck out for me, and "Hot Hot Hot!!!" was fun the first time around, but the rest felt like a step back on first listen. But on second listen, the guitar work really drew me in. "Catch" and "Why Can't I Be You" drew me in. I look forward to listening to this album again someday as well, because I wonder how it will continue to grow on me.

*Disintegration* felt like a little of a let-down for me at first. But then I hit "Lovesong" and "Homesick", and the album felt better to me. Didn't hurt that I already knew and really liked "Lovesong" - but it made me appreciate the album more. It still doesn't quite work for me as much as the previous two albums did, but it's solid.

*Wish* was another one where the second listen really helped. "Friday I'm in Love" is the star, unsurprisingly. But "From the Edge of the Deep" is great, and "A Letter to Elise" worked for me as well. The album as a whole felt like more of a complete success on second listen, with each song flowing into the next song in a way that I really enjoyed.

On my second listen, I added *Wild Mood Swings*, *The Cure*, and *4:13 Dream*. *Wild Mood Swings* was a wild ride for me: For the first three songs, I felt like it was starting strong. Then the next 7-8 songs just didn't work for me; the trumpets - and accordion? Was there an accordion? Did I imagine that - made it feel too whimsical and jaunty, which wasn't what I was looking for. Then I hit "Numb", and I felt like the album ended as strong as it started. A real sandwich of an album.

I decided about halfway through *The Cure* that mid-90's me would have loved it. Back when I was listening to a ton of Metallica, Megadeth, and the like, some of this album would have fit right in. "Before Three" was a standout for me. "Us or Them" would have been a favorite of mine 30 years ago. After listening to "Taking Off", I decided current me likes this album as well.

Finally, *4:13 Dream* was solid but not a standout for me. "Hungry Ghost" was my favorite song on there, but I can't say any other songs stood out for me. Enjoyed it, but wouldn't hurry to re-listen to it.

So here I am, now, wondering what it would be like to discover these albums over 40 years, instead of over a week. I can't really know, but I think if I had, the Cure would be very high on my list, and I'd have a deep appreciation of all their albums as I enjoyed their evolution. Even without that experience, though, I still liked them a lot. I don't think I could go wrong grabbing any of their albums from 1985-1992 right now, and I think I would like them more and more each time. I'm a little sad I didn't get into them sooner, but I'm happy I've gotten into them now.

* *The Head on the Door* is easily my favorite album. Outside of the standout songs I already knew before this week, this is the album I keep thinking about, keep wanting to revisit the most.
* I feel like I should be saying "Friday I'm in Love" or "Lovesong" is my favorite, because those are songs I've known and loved for decades - but I'm going to go with "In Between Days". I don't know if it will stand up over time like the others have for me, but that song "woke me up" when it came on, and I had thoughts like "now *this* is *The Cure*" both times. That song rocks.

I'm so glad I enjoyed *The Cure* as much as I did, and I'm really wondering how next week will go as I swerve further from my normal tastes than I have so far. Next week is... Ray Charles
