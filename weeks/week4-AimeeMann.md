What a breath of fresh air after *The Kinks*. I went from disliking most of what I heard last week to liking - if not loving - every song I heard this week. From the first song, "I Should've Known", I absolutely knew I liked Aimee Mann. Of course, I thought the same thing about *The Kinks* last week, so I figured I should be a bit cautious.

Luckily, things continued well. "Stupid Thing" rocks, and as I continued from *Whatever* into *I'm With Stupid*, right after listening to "Amateur", I knew this was going to be a much better week, and it turns out I was right. I listened to her entire discography once through, and then made it back through *The Forgotten Arm* the second time around - and there isn't a bad album in the bunch. There wasn't a single song that I didn't like. Aimee Mann might have one of the most consistent careers of any artist I've ever listened to in that regard.

Aimee's first two albums really worked for me - they were right in my genre preference. "I Should've Known" and "It's Not Safe" - the first and last songs of those two albums as a set - were two of my favorite songs of hers. She definitely evolved over her career, moving into and through a few genres, and at no point did she feel out of place to me. It all worked; those first two albums - damn, such a good start that I really loved.

And then, as soon as she moved away from rock into more of a singer-songwriter vibe, she puts out what felt like her best album: *Bachelor No. 2*. Song after song after song that continued to draw me in. The key change she does during "Deathly" while singing the chorus is haunting and awesome. "Ghost World" really stuck out to me both times through. "Save Me" and "Wise Up" are both beautiful songs. "Momentum" felt so *big* as a song, and really built itself up well. And "You Do" was thisclose to feeling like my favorite song by the end of the week.

*Lost in Space* continued the vibe of *Bachelor No. 2*, and while I didn't think it was quite as strong, I still enjoyed the entire album. And "This Is How It Goes" is an excellent song - I sent it to my wife immediately after listening to it telling her she needed to listen to it. As someone who struggles with disconnecting from people when I'm overwhelmed, this song really got to me on several levels.

Those levels were really the strength of so many of her songs. She has a great voice, she is an excellent guitarist, and her lyrics really cut to the core more often than not. I have a feeling the more I keep listening to her work, the more I will appreciate it over time.

*The Forgotten Arm* was the last album I was able to listen to twice. And the second listen really helped me appreciate it more. I came out of the first listen liking it, but I didn't feel like it lived up to the previous albums. But on second listen, I felt like it was doing something different, and that made it stand out in its own way. The lilt in her voice on "break" in "That's How I Knew This Story Would Break My Heart" grabbed me every time, it's perfect, and made me feel so much in just one word.

After that, I really wish I had had more time to listen this week. *@#%&\*! Smilers* felt like a stronger album to me than *The Forgotten Arm* the first time around, but I wonder how I'd feel now. *Charmer* washed over me, and while I enjoyed it, no single songs stuck out to me. *Mental Illness* was probably my favorite of her final four albums that I was only able to listen to once, with "Rollercoasters" really standing out to me as simply being a beautiful song. *Queens of the Summer Hotel* was solid, and deserved more attention (and more listens) than I was able to give to it.

I really look forward to revisiting Aimee Mann, listening to more of what I loved, and giving more time and attention to her work. As of now, though:

* *Whatever* is my favorite album. I just love the rock sound, her voice pairs so damn well with an electric guitar.
* I feel like *Bachelor No. 2* is her best album, even if it's not my favorite. Every song is so full of feeling, and is so well executed.
* My favorite song is "This Is How It Goes". When a song gets you, it just gets you.

After this week of just not having enough time to listen to music as much as I wanted to, it's nice to know that next week I'll be visiting with a band with a short career and a small discography. Oh, no, I'm wrong - next week is The Cure.
