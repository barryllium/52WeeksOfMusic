I've spent my last week feeling like I should be at a cookout or a street party - but the good kind, not a family one where half the people hate each other. In a week where work tried - once again - to kill me, I very much needed fun music that just made me feel good, and George Clinton delivered.

Not without a bit of confusion, though. I was aware of George Clinton (I too have seen *PCU*). I was aware of P-Funk. But I did not realize that this was not just one thing. You've got Funkadelic. You've got Parliament. And you've got George Clinton. And, while definitely having a shared DNA, these are all different things. So this led me on a journey through all three (as much as one can do in one week).

- *Maggot Brain* - Funkadelic (1971)
- *Cosmic Slop* - Funkadelic (1973)
- *Up for the Down Stroke* - Parliament (1974)
- *Standing on the Verge of Getting It On* - Funkadelic (1974) <small>second listen only</small>
- “Get Off Your Ass and Jam” - Funkadelic (1975) <small>second listen only</small>
- *Mothership Connection* - Parliament (1975)
- “One Nation Under a Groove” - Funkadelic (1978)
- *Gloryhallastoopid* - Parliament (1979)
- “(Not Just) Knee Deep” - Funkadelic (1979) <small>second listen only</small>
- “Flash Light” - Parliament (1977)
- “Atomic Dog” - George Clinton (1982)
- *Computer Games* - George Clinton (1982) <small>second listen only</small>

More than anything, this led me down memory lane. Listening to *Maggot Brain* brought me back to doing Habitat for Humanity work in college, where I was helping paint a house while a guy was blasting "Low Rider" and other War songs. And did I ever get a lesson in how much of the 90s musical lexicon sampled George Clinton. While R&B and rap aren't the genres I'm most well-versed in, I definitely caught music that was sampled by Snoop, Dr. Dre, Digital Underground, and De La Soul. And I get it - these are some sick beats that P-Funk laid down. And I'm not sure if I'm picking up on just shared influence, or if P-Funk also influenced Michael Jackson, but I definitely caught some shared vibes, especially listening to *Gloryhallastoopid*. And there is one more connection I'm almost positive I picked up on, and I'll come back to that later... but the connective tissue of P-Funk to other artists kept bringing me back repeatedly to my music-listening past.

Unlike many weeks, I didn't feel like the music took me on a journey as I listened - and that is in no way a negative. I just had fun listening to serious musicians that didn't always take their craft too seriously. Most of the music simply *made me feel happy*. I caught myself smiling repeatedly at the harmonies (were they harmonies? I don't really know, but I'm sticking with them) where one voice was singing high, and the other voice came in low. It's good music, and it made me feel good - can't ask for much more than that.

To me, the most interesting thing was how I ended up feeling about each aspect of the music. I absolutely loved the grittiness and funk of Funkadelic - pound for pound, their songs felt better on average to me. But, Parliament had the higher ceiling; if I were doing more of a ranking, I can almost guarantee my top 10 songs would be mostly Parliament. And then there's Clinton's solo work, which has a competitor for the #1 song of the week for me.

Here I am, almost two months into this musical journey, and I wonder when I'll stop being surprised by how much I like these artists. Sure, I picked a lot of artists whose work has lived on for decades and are known to have influenced many an artist, but who could have guessed they'd be good?! Not me, I guess - but George Clinton and P-Funk once again proved to be worth their inclusion on my list.

- Favorite song: I keep coming back to "Give up the Funk (Tear the Roof Off the Sucker)" in my head, humming it absentmindedly. And both times through, "Mothership Connection (Star Child)" stood out to me, and it's a fantastic song. But, before I started this week, the song I knew coming in was "Atomic Dog", and that's a hard one to unseat, and it stays at the top.
- Favorite album: *Mothership Connection* takes this easily, though *Cosmic Slop* is also a great one I look forward to revisiting some day - but *Mothership Connection* felt undeniably great, and the fact that I recognized numerous parts of several songs that ended up being famously sampled makes me feel extra good on that pick.

I have a strong feeling that I'm not diverging too far for my next artist. I thought of them on multiple occasions this week, as they also fit the "serious musicians that don't always take their music too seriously". While I know 3-4 of their songs already, I'm excited to see what I think of OutKast next week!
