I'm going to give a hot take here - Billie Eilish is good. I know, groundbreaking. Part of me feels like I could go on for 1000 words about the depths of her music and part of me feels like I don't have much to say at all beyond just general "I liked this song a lot" and "this is a great album." But I'm going to give it a shot still.

I started this knowing a few Billie Eilish songs. I already liked "bad guy", and had been around while my kids were listening to her music. And, I'm of course familiar with her and Finneas's amazing work writing the music for 4*Town in *Turning Red*. But this was the first time I'd ever gone through her albums.

I was immediately struck by the fantastic use of bass in *WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO*. The first time through, I couldn't even tell you which songs I liked or not, I was just into the album track-after-track. This honestly continued through listening to each album, for the first few trips through her discography.

By the time I got to my third time through her three albums (I listened to them all 8-9 times this week), individual songs started jumping out at me. I started looking forward to the second half of *Happier Than Ever* when I'd listen. "Everybody Dies" is just so haunting, "NDA" is great (I channeled my children and wrote "NDA slaps" in my notes), and the rise in the second half of "Happier Than Ever" builds up so well, I can feel it in my bones. It's reminiscent of Weezer's "Only in Dreams", when it seems like the song is over and then builds back up. It's just so damn good. And then the album gets me in a different way with "Male Fantasy". I am a sucker for an album-ending stripped-down number, and this song delivers in a way a special few albums do (for reference, one of my favorite all-time album-enders is "Cigarette Lighter Love Song" by *The Marvelous 3*).

And then we come to *HIT ME HARD AND SOFT*. The first few times through, coming off the high of *Happier Than Ever*, I felt like this was a good album, but it was just not quite as good as her previous two. And then I kept listening, and damn that album starts off well. "SKINNY", "LUNCH", and "BIRDS OF A FEATHER" are such a strong start to the album. "THE GREATEST", "L'AMOUR DE MA VIE", and "BLUE" rock, and rank up there with my favorite songs from her previous two albums.

Here I am now, at the end of a week listening to these three albums over and over, and I feel like I hear each album (and at times each song) in a different way each time. There are so many layers to each of her songs, it's easy to get lost in the music, or the lyrics, or even how the music and lyrics play off of each other. It's all good, and it's all fun.

* She's made it extremely difficult to pick a favorite album. Part of me wants to say "whichever album I listened to last," but in the end, I'll give it to *WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO*. "bad guy", "you should see me in a crown", "when the party's over", "my strange addiction", and "bury a friend" are all standout songs, and the rest of the album really works for me as well. And it gets bonus points for *The Office* references :D
* In spite of all that, in this moment, the second half alone of "Happier Than Ever" might be my favorite song of hers. If I'm being honest, I have 3-5 songs on each album in the running for this, and a day from now I'll have a different answer.

I've set the bar high for myself with The Pixies and Billie Eilish two weeks into this project. I'm two-for-two so far with loving the music through this project. I guess I'll see how this goes next week with The Kinks
