The idea for this project started years ago; listening to Nirvana, I realized that while knowing the Pixies were a big influence on them, I've never really listened to them.
That thought stayed with me, and kept growing to other musicians that I would hear about, and file into the back of my mind with the idea that I would check them out eventually.

A few things kept me from ever checking these artists out: I listen to a large number of podcasts, and when I do listen to music, I tend to listen to the same groups over an over.
There were years when I almost entirely just listened to Aerosmith.
The same goes for Queen, Metallica, Our Lady Peace, and a handful of other groups.
Combine that with having children — an event that resulted in nothing new entering my life for about a decade — and I've just never gotten around to any of it.

Enter this project - 52 artists, 52 weeks. Of course, I'm starting it off with the Pixies, and from there I've got a range of artists across several decades and genres.
I'm hoping to fill in some musical gaps, explore some new artists, and find new paths to music I will love.
Whether it's a seminal act that I feel like I should have explored decades ago or an artist that's come along in the past decade that is shaping a genre, I can't wait to see what "new" music I will discover.
