# 52 Weeks of Music

My entire life, I've enjoyed music by starting to listen to a band, and then listening to them repeatedly.  
There were years when I almost entirely just listened to Aerosmith.  
The same goes for Queen, Metallica, Our Lady Peace, and a handful of other groups.

Over the past decade or so, podcasts have taken over the vast majority of my listening time.  
Combine that with having children — an event that resulted in nothing new entering my life for about a decade — and I now find myself with significant gaps in my musical knowledge.  
There are musicians who have come onto the scene in the past 20 years that I've never knowingly heard a song from.  
There are others who have had a profound influence on bands that I adore, and I couldn't tell you a thing about them.  
This all makes me sad.

This project aims to remedy that.  
I've spent more time than I'd like to admit putting together a list of musical acts that fall into one of a few categories:

- Seminal acts in musical history, where I know little to none of their music  
- Artists who influenced musicians I love, and I want to understand why  
- Musicians who have emerged in the past 20 years, and I've heard enough about them that I don't want to keep missing out  
- Acts led by women and people of color, because sadly my listening history is very white-male-led  

I hope to go through these musicians a week at a time, over the course of a year.  
Will I do it? We'll see.  
Do I already have another list started in case I finish the year and want more?  
You bet I do. So here we go!
