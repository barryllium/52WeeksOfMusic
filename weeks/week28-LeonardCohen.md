I started off listening to *Songs of Leonard Cohen*, and it was a revelation. Everything I loved about artists like Aimee Mann, Tracy Chapman, and Wilco was there - beautiful acoustic guitar work and lyrics worth paying attention to. Despite a limited range, Cohen still conveyed an emotionality that pushed the lyrics to the forefront.

Immediately, "Suzanne" grabbed my attention. The arrangement of the song - with the guitar, backup vocals, and strings all beautiful. This started a pattern of subdued and simple arrangements all through the album, with the mood and feel of all the songs feeling great. From beginning to end this album was really enjoyable, with each song having something that made it stand out. Sometimes it was orchestral strings in the background, other times it was the lead guitar. "Winter Lady" even won me over with its layered guitars and occasional flute.

And then there are the lyrics. The sparse arrangement really pushes the vocals to the forefront, and that made the lyrics more striking. "The Stranger Song" is beautifully written, with powerful lines like "he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter" - those lines (and the lines around it) evoking the imagery of someone choosing to accept a life change, ranging from giving into love when it happens to giving up on a dream when life has other ideas. His delivery really pushes those possible emotions through.

"So Long, Marianne" had it all for me, from great lyrics that really take you through someone fully saying goodbye to someone ("It’s time that we began to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again" really stood out - but the entire song is full of great lyrical moments). The backing vocals are great everywhere, especially the second chorus. The music, starting with the mood set by the acoustic guitar, gets better and better as the song goes on. I love when the orchestral strings come in around the 2-minute mark, and then the 12-string guitar comes in a minute later. In an album full of songs I really liked, this one managed to stand out even more.

Most of what I loved about *Songs of Leonard Cohen* continued through into *Songs of Love and Hate*. The album kicks off hard with "Avalanche", with some catchy guitar work that gets even better when the cello comes in during the second minute, and some nice lyrics like "the crumbs of love that you offer me, they’re the crumbs I’ve left behind". Outside of "Diamonds in the Mine" - where I felt like he was angry yelling for half the song, this album is full of great music and lyrics. Orchestral strings are present in almost every song, and often served to elevate the mood and emotion of each song. "Famous Blue Raincoat" is very effective in how it starts with a stripped down vocals/guitar arrangement, with background vocals coming in around the 1:45 mark to elevate the song, and I love whenever the second guitar comes through more. A few songs had some buildups that I loved, a notable one is "Sing Another Song, Boys" - the vocals and music complement each other well as they build up together multiple times. "Joan of Arc" is beautiful in its arrangement and layered vocals, up until we get to the parts where he just sings "la la la" (a recurring issue at the end of this album and some later albums). But my highlight for this album is without a doubt "Love Calls You By Your Name". It had me from the first line: "You thought that it could never happen to all the people that you became". The arrangement is (a word I keep using, but it keeps fitting) beautiful, starting with just the guitar, and then the vocals come in. Halfway in, the orchestral strings come in, and then 2/3 of the way through, there is a great synth buildup. But the thing I perhaps love the most is the mix between the guitar ramping up while he slowly sings the titular line of the chorus in a restrained manner. And then, the music dies down again with the next verse, only to build back up again. All of this works for me. Add it to the formula I'm developing of the 100 exact ways to make a song that I will love.

Next we come to *New Skin for the Old Ceremony*. I’m going to get my big critique out of the way early on this. I have no problem with a song about sex. Between Marvin Gaye, Boys II Men, and Warrant, I’ve heard and enjoyed my fair share of them. But when you make an entire album about it, you kinda end up sounding a bit creepy. Yes, I’m over-generalizing the album; the album is not *only* about sex, and it’s not like it’s "look how much sex I’m having and I’m so good at sex". But for me, the constant focus on it took away from what some songs had to offer, pulling me out of where a song had begun to take me.

But with all that said, I liked several songs on this album. "Chelsea Hotel #2" has a beautiful, calming arrangement that highlight some solid vocals, and the lyrics are full of great purposeful contradictions. "Lover Lover Lover" had a great beat and features some great harmonica moments. "Who By Fire" has some great harmonies, and the music was my favorite on the album; the bass/upright bass give the song a great deal of depth, and the guitars and mandolin elevate the song from there. And the orchestral strings playing "Green Sleeves" in the background of "Leaving Green Sleeves" is beautiful.

OK, and now we will do a thought experiment as we reach this crucial inflection point of my experience this week. What would the world be like if Leonard Cohen had ended his career at this point?

Cons:

* We don't get "Hallelujah", a fantastic and well-known song
* We don't get fantastic later lyrics like "There is a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in"

Pros:

* I don't have to write everything I'm about to write.

Time did not treat Leonard Cohen and his voice well. Overall, *Various Positions*, *I’m Your Man*, and *Old Ideas* did not work for me, with his vocal range and delivery getting worse and worse through each album - to the point that he's mostly talking in the final two albums. Even when he is singing, his voice is stuck in a deep monotone voice; if you told me it was [Powers Booth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZxxMg-FCt4&t=50s) singing, I would have believed you. Even "Hallelujah", probably the most well known song off of those albums, isn't (in my opinion) the best version of that song. I'll take Jeff Buckley's version (or, if I really get to pick, listen to my wife sing it) over Leonard Cohen's any day. The vocals ended up making these albums mostly unenjoyable.

That's not to say there aren't good things in these albums. On my second listen, I found myself appreciating them more than the first time around. And yet, both times through, I found myself getting mad, feeling like his vocal performance was ruining songs that might be really good without him. Jennifer Warnes gives a wonderful vocal performance throughout most songs in *Various Positions*. In fact, every vocal artist on that album not named Leonard Cohen does. And where he fails as a vocalist, Cohen does come through as a composer: almost all of the musical arrangments are great. "Take This Waltz (Paris Version)" is a really beautiful song, and Jennifer Warnes absolutely kills it (and, to be fair, Cohen's vocals are actually decent as well). "Jazz Police" has a piano break that takes me from "I hate this song" to "but I *love* this part of the song". Several songs on *I'm Your Man* feature some great synthesizer music; background vocals - often used like a vocal instrument - are often the highlight of a song. "Crazy to Love You" is lovely from start to finish, and easily his best vocal performance of *Old Ideas*. But you have songs like "Show Me the Place" where I really like the music, but the vocals just do not fit, and make it a song that I overall don't like. Or "Come Healing" - which starts out with Dana Glover singing, and I'm immediately rapt by her vocals and the music (especially the violin). But then Leonard Cohen joins in and I just want his voice to go away. Even when he hits a lot of marks for a song, his vocal performance sadly just kills my interest more often than not.

But hey, there was good stuff:

* Favorite Album: Easy decision, it's *Songs of Leonard Cohen*. For all that he "did wrong" later in his career, he does those things right early. I was enraptured by the music of every song, and the vocals often complemented the music both in style and especially with the lyrics. There is a lot I won't revisit this week, but I would happily listen to this album at any point.
* Favorite Song: Even though I have a pretty decent second-tier list for this week, of songs I liked a lot, this was a two horse race for favorite: "So Long, Marianne" and "Love Calls You By Your Name". And because I'm a softy who [loves love](https://cdn.vlipsy.com/clips/zwrU6YGp/480p-watermark.mp4?token=v1_f_1770320542_Nzq3qYzJR), I have to give it to "Love Calls You By Your Name" in the end.

After a week that started out with great promise but then fizzled, what will I get next week with Run-DMC?
