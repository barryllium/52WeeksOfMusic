This. This is one of the main reasons I wanted to do this project. I had never even heard of Siouxsie and the Banshees before this year - and now, sorry to spoil things, I absolutely love them.

When I was putting together my list for this project, I had about 40 artists, and then started purposely trying to find women and BIPOC artists to add to the list (a sad gap in my mostly white-men-led listening of my youth). Siouxsie and the Banshees came up in my research, and then a week or two later I heard [this podcast episode](https://songexploder.net/shirley-manson), which felt like a sign of some sort, so it sealed the deal.

And so this week, I got to enjoy some great music:

* *The Scream* (1978)
* *Join Hands* (1979) — <small>second playthrough only</small>
* *Kaleidoscope* (1980)
* "Drop Dead/Celebration" (1980)
* *Juju* (1981)
* *A Kiss in the Dreamhouse* (1982)
* *Hyaena* (1984) —  <small>second playthrough only</small>
* *Tinderbox* (1986)

After a week of waffling on how I felt about Morrissey's vocals, it was such a relief by the time I was halfway through the second song on *The Scream*, "Jigsaw Feeling", and I knew I was going to love the vocals all week long. Siouxsie Sioux can flat-out sing, and I could feel how she influenced other musicians as I listened to her. I could hear her in Shirley Manson, and I repeatedly was taken back to listening to [PJ Harvey](https://barrylliumlabs.com/music/post.html?file=week7-PJHarvey.md) just a few months ago. But more than that, I was impressed by her range and presence vocally - I'm sure this is sacrilege, but I found myself thinking of Ann Wilson at several points, her presence was so strong.

But it wasn't all about her voice - the band (and their numerous guitarists throughout the albums) does amazing work. The bass grabbed me early in "Jigsaw Feeling", the guitar is fantastic in "Helter Skelter", and songs like "Mirage", "Switch", and *especially* "Overground" had amazing music throughout - that paired well with the vocals.

*Join Hands* was the closest thing to a miss for me on the week - and it still had moments I liked a lot. The vocals are so strong in "Premature Burial", but I felt a little let down by the music. "Playground Twist", on the other hand, had great music to it - but nothing in it stood out enough to say "this part makes the song great". But the album was my sole down spot of the week.

Thankfully, *Kaleidoscope* kicks off with "Happy House", one of my favorite songs of the week. The way the song slowly brings in multiple instruments in the intro, and then strips some of them out as soon as the vocals start is just fantastic; and the bridge gives a great tempo change leading back into the verse. The rest of the album is strong, but doesn't quite reach the height of "Happy House" - "Hybrid", "Christine", and "Skin" all have some great music, and "Lunar Camel" is a weirdly weird song that still somehow works because the vocals are fantastic.

And then we get to *Juju*, an album that starts out strong and stays strong. "Spellbound" was the first song where I really started getting Ann Wilson vibes, part of it is Siouxsie Sioux's sheer presence, but it was something more that I can't quite put my finger on. "Into the Light" has a great intro, and while the drums are the heart of the song, the guitar continually elevates the song. Song after song delivers, as we build up to my favorite song on this album: "Sin in My Heart". The musical buildup is so good: first the percussion, then some guitar, then the bass, and then the vocals come in so strong. In an album of great intros, this song is the best. The entire song, from intro through a late tempo shift, is a journey that I loved.

*A Kiss in the Dreamhouse* doesn't disappoint either. "Cascade" has fantastic vocals, guitar, and drums through the entire song. The bare bones start to "Obsession" leans into Siouxsie's vocals perfectly, and I love how the strings come in during the second half of the song. And the mood is set perfectly by the "heartbeat" the percussion provides from start to finish. And "Cocoon" stands out because it's so drastically different and yet so well done - the jazzy bass line and vocals are spot on, and the piano is fantastic.

Providing even more of a different feel is "Dazzle", leading off *Hyaena*. I was a bit confused at first – when the symphony started, I thought I had put on the wrong album. But then the vocals start, and a bit after the minute mark, the drums and guitar kick in - and the song "just works". Somehow the symphony works alone (intro/outro) and with the band playing. "Dazzle" alone made the album worth adding in my second playthrough, even though *Hyaena* doesn't continue with that feel, and then has a few songs that lacked something for me, outside of "Bring Me the Head of the Preacher Man", "Running Town", and "Blow the House Down". But compared to the few albums before this, and what comes next, it just doesn't live up to the rest of the body of work.

Especially when the week ends with *Tinderbox* - an album that I liked, and then liked even more the second time around. "Candyman" has some great tempo and "grit" changes throughout, and the vocals are awesome. "Sweetest Chill" starts out with a great guitar riff, and establishes a great feel between the bass and vocals - and leads directly into "This Unrest". When the drums and guitar kick in around the 30-second mark of "This Unrest", the feel changes to something even greater, and are then complemented by some perfectly dramatic vocals. The song has a handful of tempo changes, and both the slower and faster parts are great, and they transition between each other so well. And then "Cities in Dust" comes on, with a different feel, and it still rocks. The vocals are so good, and the music fits perfectly with them.

I kept waiting for a song to let me down as I continued through the rest of the album - and even though it couldn't keep up with the amazing start to the album, that was more of a nod to how good the album starts than to how it finishes. "Cannons" has great drums and vocals, "Party's Fall" has some next-level vocals, "92 Degrees" has some great moments of drums/guitar pairing (and again, great vocals), and "Land's End" has some great transitions throughout, with some solid music highlighting some understated (but still great) vocals.

These are the weeks I love, where I come out of it almost being worried that I'm forgetting to be critical because I liked everything so much. We can definitely add Siouxsie and the Banshees to the list of artists that I'm looking forward to listening to again down the road.

* Favorite album: I really thought this was going to be *Juju* after my first playthrough, because it's a really good album with some of my favorite songs of the week on it. But my second playthrough of *Tinderbox* changed my mind entirely. There is not a bad song on the album, and the first four songs are *so* good. Most of all, though, this album felt like it let Siouxsie flex a bit more - her vocals led more songs, she showcased her range more, and her presence felt even stronger - and that's what put the album up top for me.
* Favorite song: This was not easy. I ended up with 8 songs that I put in a "playoff", giving them another listen: "Overground", "Happy House", "Spellbound", "Sin in My Heart", "Cascade", "Obsession", "This Unrest", and "Cities in Dust". Despite still loving all these songs, "Sin in My Heart" just barely stands above the rest. The intro is so good, the vocals are so strong, and the musical journey the song takes me through is top notch.

As I continue my run of "bands I just learned about", next week I'll be listening to that band that I'm sure everyone else has already heard of: King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard.
