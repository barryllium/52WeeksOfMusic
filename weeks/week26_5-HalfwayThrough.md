Halfway through. It’s been quite a journey already. My first week, I had about 200 words. Last week, about 1700. I’m listening to music differently - and not linearly. I’m definitely finding that each and every week I’m influenced by the past few weeks. A great lyrics week (like Tracy Chapman)? I’m paying attention to the lyrics more for a few weeks. After The Rolling Stones, I started wanting to know what instrument is making each and every sound. I’m hearing things in music I never really heard before, and it makes me excited to revisit music I’ve loved for years. I’ve even found a few artists where my opinion has continued to evolve weeks after I first listened to them; Miles Davis week changed my mind about John Coltrane, and I have to admit it, I’ve been thinking about The Smiths since the moment I stopped listening to them. For all I talked about not loving Morrissey’s vocals, I can’t deny how effective they are - I’ve had fragments of songs like “Reel Around the Fountain” (a song I didn’t even really like much at the time) stuck in my head ever since.

What I am finding most interesting is which artists live on in my head the longest after I move on. Sometimes it’s because I hear the influence of an artist from a previous week influencing the current artist (or vice versa). Other times it’s a song that my brain can’t let go of even though I’ve moved on. This is what makes me excited to revisit some of these artists again after another six months.

Which leads me to some of the things I’ve learned so far:

* Sometimes a week isn’t nearly enough, sometimes it’s too much. 
* There really is no way for me to know in advance if a second listen to a song or album will change my mind about it. I’ve had songs I loved the first time around, and then felt meh about on a second listen. And songs that didn’t move me on the first take, but then felt amazing the second time around. 
* I really do love music, and I’m so glad I gave myself this project. I still listen to a lot of podcasts, but for about 10 years that’s about all I listened to. Music makes me feel more, makes me feel more alive. 

Because I feel like I’m discovering my voice week-by-week, and also learning more of what I do and don’t like with each artist, in some ways I feel like I’m just getting started with this. So being halfway through doesn’t even feel possible. And yet, I know I still have a lot of *huge* artists to come in the next six months. Can’t wait to see who I love, who I hate, and who I keep changing my mind about weeks after listening to them. Second half of the list, here I come!
