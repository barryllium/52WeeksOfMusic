The sum is greater than the parts - but the parts are all really damn good.

I started this week out "wrong". Originally, this was Phoebe Bridgers' week, with her work in boygenius as an add-on. I knew I wanted to add boygenius, because I listened to a [Song Exploder podcast episode about Lucy Dacus's "Thumbs"](https://songexploder.net/lucy-dacus), and I knew she was part of boygenius.

For my first playthrough, I really thought that "Phoebe Bridgers + boygenius" was really how the week was going to go. So many of her songs really touched and moved me, they spoke to me on deep levels. It helped that I was having a really fragile week; I was burnt out, overworked, anxiety was high. Honestly, I needed a good cry, and her music brought me to the edge of that. Apparently, the universe knew what it was doing when it put this artist on this week.

But, as the week went on, I realized this needed to be boygenius week, and my playlist ended up like this:

- *Turn Out the Lights* (Julien Baker, 2017) <small>third listen only</small>
- *Stranger in the Alps* (Phoebe Bridgers, 2017)
- *Historian* (Lucy Dacus, 2018) <small>third listen only</small>
- *boygenius* (EP, boygenius, 2018)
- *Punisher* (Phoebe Bridgers, 2020)
- "Thumbs" (Lucy Dacus, 2021) <small>third listen only</small>
- "Faith Healer" (Julien Baker, 2021) <small>third listen only</small>
- *the record* (boygenius, 2023)

*Stranger in the Alps* is an amazing debut album. "Motion Sickness" is on the album twice, the second time as a demo, and I'm still not sure which version I like best. But the line "I have emotional motion sickness" has stuck with me from the very first time I heard it. "Funeral" is haunting and sad, and does both of those things well. "Georgia" builds up from start to finish, and the entire buildup is so damn good. "You Missed My Heart" is somehow simple and complicated at the same time, and emotionally affecting throughout.

For as good as *Stranger in the Alps* is, *Punisher* is a big step up. Whereas *Stranger in the Alps* is emotional and mellow, *Punisher* keeps the emotion while adding a lot more on the instrumental end - which is all for the better. Each time, I liked this album even more. Listening to "Garden Song", I realized how much of a yearning, earnest quality her voice has to it - it really does draw me in. Some songs, like "Kyoto", "ICU", and "I Know the End" started out as songs that I kinda liked, and then consistently grew on me every time I listened to the album. Other songs — such as "Chinese Satellite", "Moon Song", and "Savior Complex" — grabbed me fully the first time through, and further playthroughs made me love them even more. With where I was a week ago when I listened to it the first time, "Chinese Satellite" almost broke me - "I've been running around in circles, Pretending to be myself. Why would somebody do this on purpose? When they can do something else" got me in a moment where the idea of being me wasn't feeling so great.

The first time I listened to *boygenius* and *the record*, I started out feeling like I liked her solo work more than her boygenius work. I had connected with her solo work so much initially, in retrospect I think I just wanted more of that. That's not to say I didn't love some of it the first time around - songs like "Salt in the Wound" and "Emily I'm Sorry" blew me away the first time around. By the end, I was fully into the boygenius vibe.

Starting my second playthrough, I found myself appreciating her solo work even more; yet, at the same time, I appreciated boygenius even more. *Stranger in the Alps* is so mellow, almost muted in some ways (yet still full of emotion and power) that I kind of missed the harmonies and instrumental work that was there through *boygenius* and *the record*.

So, by the time I got back to *boygenius*, all of a sudden every song stuck out to me. "Bite the Hand" really highlights how their voices play off of each other. I actually got Dixie Chicks vibes from "Me & My Dog" (but better, because less country) - the harmonies were spot on. In both "Souvenir" and "Stay Down" I started to realize how much I love Julien Baker's voice and guitar playing. She really shines on those songs, and at that point I made the decision that this was boygenius week, and on my next playthrough I was going to add some of her and Lucy's solo work.

I doubled down on this decision listening to *the record* for the second time. This went from being an album I liked almost as much as Phoebe's solo work to an album that I *undoubtedly liked more* than her solo work. And I also knew that Julien was my favorite part of the group - her voice has another level to it, that the emotion (and often pain) comes through in a way that I can't help but feel it. "$20", "Cool About It", "Not Strong Enough", "Revolution 0", "Satanist" (in which the guitar work reminds me of "Possum Kingdom" by the Toadies), "We're in Love", and "Anti-Curse" really stood out to me in a way they didn't the first time around. I was so glad to get a second go on this album, and I was really looking forward to a third listen.

My third round started out with Julien's second album, *Turn Out the Lights*. I can, and will, say more about this album, but the best thing I can say is that I can't wait to listen to this album again, and listen to more of her work. I even texted the album to my oldest kid, saying they needed to check it out (we have talked about boygenius previously). Julien's vocals and guitar work shine through the entire album. "Appointments" breaks the album open strongly right from the second track, and "Turn Out the Lights" is amazing. The pain in her voice in "Shadowboxing" is tactile. "Hurts Less" really grabbed me. And at the end of the album, my notes simply say "I have no words for the end of 'Claws in Your Back'. Wow."

As I transitioned back into *Stranger in the Alps*, I found myself missing Julien. I still connected with Phoebe's work, but the transition had happened - Julien was my favorite member of boygenius. With that said, Motion Sickness still got me every time, it's a legitimately great song.

As I shifted into Lucy Dacus's *Historian*, I couldn't help but feel a little bit let down. There are some good songs on there, "Addictions" has a great beat, "Nonbeliever" really pulled me in, "Timefighter" has some great guitar work, and "Historians" had some amazing depth to it. But, I just wasn't grabbed by the album as much as I was by any of the other albums this week. A part of me wonders how much I would have liked it if I had listened to it first - Lucy's voice has an honesty to it that I loved, but I left this album feeling like her voice is raised so much when it's accompanied by Phoebe and/or Julien that her solo album left me feeling lacking.

I won't spend a lot more digital ink on *boygenius* and *Punisher*, other than to say that these albums grew on me even more the third time around. "Chinese Satellite"/"Moon Song"/"Savior Complex" is such a powerful back-to-back-to-back, and *boygenius* really hits on every song.

Before my final listen of *the record*, I hit two more singles. Lucy Dacus's "Thumbs", the one song I had heard before this week, delivers. It's beautiful, it's brutal, and her vocals are on full display. In this instance, I didn't miss Julien and Phoebe, which makes me wonder how I would feel about more of her work. It's such a powerful song.

Julien Baker's "Faith Healer" was what she does best - fantastic guitar work with a vocal performance full of emotion. I can't say it's better than my favorite songs from *Turn Out the Lights*, but it's still really good.

Finishing out the week was my third listen to *the record*. This time, I feel like every song stuck out to me even more. "$20" continued to grow on me. "Emily I'm Sorry" somehow felt even better. "True Blue" jumped up to the top of my list - Lucy's performance and the lyrics spoke to me in a way I just hadn't noticed the first two times through. At this point, I could just list every song on the album, they really just grabbed me more and more, especially "Anti-Curse".

Here we are, a week later, and "Phoebe Bridgers + boygenius" week has officially turned into "boygenius + Julien Baker + Phoebe Bridgers + Lucy Dacus" week. So glad I made the switch. I would immediately listen to any album by boygenius or any of them individually if it came out tomorrow, they all have something I enjoyed enough to want to seek more out.

- Favorite album: *the record* takes it. By the end of the week, I just love how their voices work together, whether it was the harmonies or sometimes where they echo each other, play off each other, or just swap who is singing lead within songs. And the instrumental work is fantastic throughout the album.
- Favorite song: this is tougher. I could say that "Thumbs" is easily my favorite Lucy Dacus song, that "Motion Sickness", "Chinese Satellite", and "Moon Song" are warring in my head for favorite Phoebe Bridgers song, and "Turn Out the Lights" is my favorite Julien Baker song, followed by almost all of her other songs just a hair behind them. And I feel like I'm stuck between half a dozen boygenius songs. I honestly don't want to choose. I even asked ChatGPT to analyze my notes and guess what my favorite songs were (it chose "Emily I'm Sorry"). In this moment, I will fall back on my gut. There is only one song that I sent to my wife this week, and it was "True Blue", sent after my third playthrough. I always know when I send a song to her, that's when I really love and connect to a song.

Through thirteen weeks, I've had several feelings at the end of the week. There have been "thank the gods that week is over" weeks (looking at you, The Kinks and John Coltrane). Most weeks have been "I'm so glad I introduced myself to this artist" weeks. And then there are weeks like this one, where I actively look forward to revisiting the music I've listened to, and diving into even more of it. I'm officially a boygenius fan.

Next week, Chance the Rapper
