A few months ago I had never heard of PJ Harvey. I had a list of around 30 artists that I knew I wanted to look into, and was looking to round out my list to 52. So, I fired up ChatGPT and began asking it to fill in gaps with a combination of artists that were influential on artists that I liked, seminal acts of different time periods, or newer artists that are gaining renown. Of the entire list, PJ Harvey was the only one where I thought "I wonder who PJ Harvey is, I've never heard of him." And, with a quick look at Wikipedia, I learned how wrong my initial thought even was.

I should have seen that coming - I also asked ChatGPT to favor women and artists of color, because I have a largely white male musical listening history; one which was shoved back in my face even more the second I found out that PJ Harvey is a woman.

And now, here I am, a few months later after listening to her music, and I'm just mad I didn't know about her decades ago. I can sum this week up in a quick statement: PJ Harvey absolutely rocks.

Here is this week's playlist:

- “Dress” (1991 single)
- “Sheela-Na-Gig” (1992 single)
- *Dry* (1992)
- *Rid of Me* (1993)
- *4-Track Demos* (1993) - <small>*second listen through only*</small>
- *To Bring You My Love* (1995)
- *Is This Desire?* (1998) - <small>*second listen through only*</small>
- *Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea* (2000)
- *Let England Shake* (2011)

Normally this is where I would go through album by album and talk about how my feelings evolved from album to album. But I can simplify this greatly. Starting with the demo of "Dress", I was hooked. That feeling continued all the way through my first listen to *Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea*, and just kept growing.

Immediately - literally while listening to the demo of "Dress" - I felt like I understood her influence. It took half a song for me to think that PJ was definitely an influence on [Skye Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skye_Wallace), an artist that my family found out about from the absolutely amazing podcast [Planet Arcana](https://www.planetarcana.com). And I was right, PJ was a major influence on Skye. And as I continued to listen to her music, I heard her influence on other bands I've listened to over the years, like Garbage and Sneaker Pimps. It took very few songs to know this was going to be a good week.

There were a few songs here and there that didn't work for me (looking at you, "Man-Size Sextet"), but I ended up writing so many songs on my list that I loved, it became a never-ending stream of "*Song X* is great".

But... even through two listens, *Let England Shake* did not work for me. It is such a standout from her other albums that I listened to, where there were 2-3 songs that I liked ("All & Everyone", "In the Dark Places", "Bitter Branches"), but they were the exception. Some songs, like "The Glorious Land", had music that I loved, but the lyrics just took me away from the music too much. I understand that this album is a statement on war and politics, but overall it just did not work for me.

But I want to focus more on the positives, which is pretty much everything else. Adding in *Is this Desire* was amazing for my second listen, as it fit perfectly with the rest of her early albums. *4-Track Demos* was an interesting addition, and I appreciated the raw sounds of many of the songs that I liked on *Rid of Me*, plus I got a few more songs like "Driving" that I'm glad I didn't miss out on.

PJ really flexes her vocals like an instrument. Her voice adds layers to her song, both adding emotional depth and also meshing perfectly with the music in a way that elevates both her voice and the music. Songs like "Missed" really showcase the power and emotion. And there were several songs throughout all the albums where I was struck by how her switches between her deep voice, normal tone, and head voice would take me on a journey with her through the song.

I find myself once again wishing I just had more time. With each album I found myself saying "this is clearly my favorite album" until the next album started. And I would have a favorite song for about 6 tracks until another song became my favorite song. For the first time in this process, I actually forced myself to listen to my list of "possible favorites" at the end of my second listen through, because I had a dozen favorites. Unlike previous weeks, where I somehow just had 2-3 songs stand out, this week I felt like there were no standouts because there were so many standouts. And this isn't one of those "if you have two starting QB's, then you have zero starting QB's" scenarios. Songs kept, one after another, raising the bar for me - only to go back and revisit a "previous favorite" and have that raise the bar again with a fresh listen. So, how do I do this...

- Favorite album - Through my first listen, and most of the way through my second listen, I felt like this was going to be easy. I had already written the sentence in my mind: "*To Bring You My Love* is probably her best album, but *Dry* is my favorite." I felt like *Dry* was so much better than any first album had a right to be (and it is), and I was sure this was my answer... and then I re-listened to *Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea*. I felt like she reached a pinnacle with this album, so many songs absolutely got through to me on many levels and hooked me. I knew I liked the album the first time around, but the second listen really brought it home for me.
- Favorite song - "Big Exit" takes this for me. I'm humming it in my head, it gets to the core of me. But it's close. "Dress", "Sheela-Na-Gig", "Missed", "Snake", and "Down by the Water" all came really close (with "Down by the Water" being the closest).

Once again I find myself leaving an artist (too soon) and feeling like they are going to be a hard act to follow. We'll see next week if George Clinton is up to the task.
