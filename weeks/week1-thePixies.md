This was a wild ride. I came into this simply expecting to love the Pixies, right from the start. I knew "Where Is My Mind", because I too have seen "Fight Club", and knew I really liked it - so I set up a playlist with their first five albums (the original Kim Deal era). I kicked it off, expecting to hear five albums' worth of "Where Is My Mind". And... I wasn't sure what to think. Throughout my first listen to *Come On Pilgrim*, I just kept not quite getting drawn in. Then *Surfer Rosa* started, and I started to feel a stronger connection to the music as a whole. But, despite that, I still wasn't *loving* The Pixies.

And then "Gigantic" started. I stopped what I was doing completely. I was pulled in entirely from the first bass line. Kim Deal started singing, and I was all in on this song. Two songs later I got "Where Is My Mind", and thought "OK, yes, I do really like this song", and I kept getting more and more into the rest of the album as I finished it.

Next, I got to *Doolittle*, and from my first listen this became an album that I liked from start to end. "Debaser" is a great album starter. "I Bleed" really grabbed me the on first listen (and I immediately felt the Pixies influence on Weezer). When "Hey" finished, I immediately started the song over and listened again - I don't know what it was, but something of the song brought me back to being a teenager listening to Jim Morrison yelling *Hello* at the end of "Hello, I Love You". For as much as I got into several songs on *Surfer Rosa*, I got into *Doolittle* as a whole even more.

*Bossanova* felt a little too smooth or refined for me in my initial listen - but by the time I got to the stretch of "Ana" through "Blown Away", I was just as into it as I was all of *Doolittle*.

By the time I got to *Trompe Le Monde*, I was just into the vibe of the Pixies. I don't know what the general feeling is about any of the albums, but I ended up really liking *Trompe Le Monde* as a whole. I can't even say "these were the songs that really stuck out to me", but the vibe of the album just washed over me in a good way.

After making it through all five albums, it was time to listen again. So I did. And I did it again. And by the time I finished, I ended up thinking:

* If I had to pick one song, it would be "Gigantic". It grabs me every time, and I've already put the Breeders on my list to check out as soon as I finish this project.
* *Doolittle* is my easy pick for favorite album. *Surfer Rosa* has the higher highs with "Gigantic" and "Where Is My Mind", but *Doolittle* kept me rapt from start to finish
* From the second listen in, *Come On Pilgrim* won me over. I found "Caribou", "Ed is Dead", "The Holiday Song", "Iâ€™ve Been Tired", and "Levitate Me" all playing in my head throughout the week
* *Bossanova* still doesn't grab me right from the start, but I really dig the middle.

When all is said and done, The Pixies have earned a spot my rotation, and couldn't have been a better start to this project.

Next up... Billie Eilish
