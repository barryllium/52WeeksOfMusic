When I was a wee lad in the early 90s, I did something many people of my generation did - I discovered (and joined) Columbia House (and soon after, BMG). 12 cassettes (yes, *cassettes*) for the price of one. I remember my older brother and I coordinating so he would order from Apt. 1 at our address, and I would order from Apt. 2. And I'm pretty sure one of us later made another account from Apt. 3. To this day I don't know if there were really any rules about having multiple accounts at the same house, but we were pretty sure that we were cheating the system.

When I was picking out my cassettes, I remember some of my original picks: Aerosmith's *Pump*, Pearl Jam's *Ten* - but most of all, I remember getting Metallica's Black Album and Megadeth's *Countdown to Extinction*. This is because my mother made me go to the music store at the mall with her to make sure that these albums wouldn't corrupt my young innocent soul. Thankfully, the twenty-something-year-old employee assured her that Metallica and Megadeth mainly wrote politically themed music. But there were a few artists<sup>*</sup> that did not make the cut - and it didn't even take a trip to the music store. Guns N' Roses were not allowed because of [language](https://media.tenor.com/cYN46acNMTQAAAAC/captain-america.gif) and â€” most pertinent to this week's artist â€” Ozzy Osbourne was forbidden because of [Satan](https://i.giphy.com/3oriOaLBINGcizAdJm.webp).

Now here I am, about 30+ years later, and for the first time ever, I'm diving into my Black Sabbath playlist:

- "Evil Woman" (1970)
- *Black Sabbath* (1970)
- *Paranoid* (1970)
- *Master of Reality* (1971)
- *Vol. 4* (1972)
- *Sabbath Bloody Sabbath* (1973)
- "Am I Going Insane (Radio)" (1975)
- "Symptom of the Universe" (1975) <small>second listen only</small>
- "Dirty Women" (1976) <small>second listen only</small>
- "Never Say Die" (1978) <small>second listen only</small>
- *Heaven and Hell* (1980)

Right off the bat, "Evil Woman" was not what I expected; somewhere in the back of my brain, I was expecting something extra aggressive like Slipknot or Pantera. I was not expecting something that sounded more familiar and approachable to the rock and heavy metal I grew up listening to.

This continued into *Black Sabbath*, where I was surprised by the blues influence that was very evident in "The Wizard". And I felt right at home with all of the amazing guitar and drum work. It became immediately apparent to me the influence that Black Sabbath had, because it clearly inspired and permeated bands like Metallica and Megadeth. This was a solid album, with "The Wizard" being a huge standout for me. And I have to give massive credit to Black Sabbath on the fact that this album starts a trend of having some great instrumental tracks, none of which were 10-20 minutes long (something that annoyed me a lot as a teenager).

*Paranoid* is where things really kick in. Right off the bat, "War Pigs/Luke's Wall" made me think of Metallica's "One" and Megadeth's "Sweating Bullets" (I half expected Dave Mustaine to start saying "Hello me, meet the real me" at one point). The guitar and drum work really kicked it up a notch throughout the song, setting a strong start for the album. And that only got better with "Paranoid", a song I knew but didn't know the name to. Paranoid is, in my mind, a genre-defining song. I could go on about it for a while, and I probably will later. "Planet Caravan" did not work for me, and would have threatened to take me out of the album if it wasn't followed by "Iron Man", the one song I knew that I knew coming into this week. "Iron Man" is another foundational song, and is top to bottom great. "Electric Funeral" and "Rat Salad" had some standout guitar work in them, and "Hand of Doom" sat between them somehow making me think both of The Doors and Alice in Chains. Outside of Planet Caravan, this album really hits it out of the park, repeatedly. I had to look it up, and it didn't shock me at all that it was #139 all-time on *Rolling Stoneâ€™s* 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list (12 spots behind Ray Charles' *Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music*, which I've decided I famously didn't love).

Continuing on to *Master of Reality*, "Sweet Leaf" super worked for me, and I now have a running argument in my head as to whether or not I really knew that song. The guitar work in "After Forever" once again blew me away. But what I really want to talk about on this album are "Orchid" and "Solitude". Where did these songs come from? "Orchid" is a legit *beautiful* song. And "Solitude" might be my favorite song on the album. This album, more than anything, left me feeling like my favorite songs on it are "the songs that shouldn't be my favorite songs on it", but these songs moved me. Yes, the heavier songs are great, and I liked them, but the softer songs evoked something in me, and that was something I definitively *did not* expect to feel this week.

And guess what - *Vol. 4* did it all again. Yes, "Wheels of Confusion/The Straightener" has some sick guitar work, especially near the end. "St. Vitus Dance" has some solid work in it as well. And "Supernaut" is a powerhouse of a song. But where did "Changes" and "Laguna Sunrise" come from? The second time I listened to Laguna Sunrise, I felt like it must be a completely different band playing it, because it was just so different than the majority of their work. In the end, I'm here for all of it. "Supernaut" can amp me up, and "Changes" can make me feel. Not an insignificant accomplishment. Makes me think a lot about songs like "Nothing Else Matters", where the song stands out to me because of what the artist does *differently* than they normally do - and they do it well.

*Sabbath Bloody Sabbath* is back to mainly being the heavy metal rock I thought I was in for. "Sabbath Bloody Sabbath" builds up to a great second half. "A National Acrobat" works for me big time, ending in some of the best guitar work on the album. "Sabbra Cadabra" and "Spiral Architect" stood out both playthroughs as well, especially the symphonic backing to "Spiral Architect". But, once again, I found myself taken aback by "Fluff". Another "where did this song come from" song, more than anything making me appreciate the artistry of Black Sabbath that I did not know I was getting into.

I don't have a lot to say about the singles I listened to before heading into Black Sabbath's second era. They were all solid, I liked some ("Am I Going Insane (Radio)") more than others ("Dirty Women").

And then, finally, I ended with *Heaven and Hell*, Black Sabbath's first album without Ozzy Osbourne and with Ronnie James Dio on vocals. There are some solid songs on this album, helped by the fact that you still have an amazing guitarist and drummer at work. "Neon Knights", "Children of the Sea", "Die Young", and "Walk Away" all caught my attention. But more than anything, I was struck by how much character and charisma is missing without Ozzy at the helm. At times, I felt like Dio was trying to be Ozzy, at other times, it just felt like this could be some random rock band, but it just didn't feel like Black Sabbath. And I'm saying that after a week; I can't imagine what people who were listening to them in the 70s felt like. I knew I wasn't planning on exploring post-Ozzy Black Sabbath much, and perhaps that colored my perception, but it really did just feel lacking.

A week later, and I'm pretty sure my soul wasn't destroyed by Black Sabbath. I wasn't sure how I was going to feel coming into this week, as I have a pocket that metal needs to fit into for me. I love the bands I grew up listening to (Metallica, Megadeth, Deftones) but there are others that have something to them that just doesn't work for me (Tool, Korn, Pantera) - and I was worried that Black Sabbath would fall into the latter. But they didn't, and I'm really happy about that. I'm glad to have a much better idea of what they actually were, the influence they clearly had on much of my music listening throughout my entire life, and have a few more songs that I genuinely really like to revisit for years to come.

- Favorite Album: This is an easy one for me, *Paranoid*. It's one "Planet Caravan" away from being a perfect album for me. The only thing that could have made it better is if they threw in one of the songs that took me off guard (in a great way) from the later albums, showing more of their artistry.
- Favorite Song: This, on the other hand, is difficult. Part of me wants to choose one of those off-brand songs, like "Changes" or "Solitude" â€” or even one of the instrumentals like "Orchid" or "Laguna Sunrise", because I really liked those songs. But in a rare occurrence, my favorite album and song have the same name. "Paranoid" is a perfect rock song for me. It's got amazing guitar work, the drums are spot on, and it has legit non-nonsense lyrics. It doesn't hurt that I already knew the song (even though I didn't know the name!), but it's their best song that fits in with what I was expecting, and it's a legit great song.

Next week, I come back to a modern artist for the first time in a few weeks: Phoebe Bridgers and boygenius.
