Let's hop right into the playlist:

* *Waiter: "You Vultures!"* (2006)
* *The Satanic Satanist* (2009)
* *In the Mountain in the Cloud* (2011)
* *Evil Friends* (2013)
* *Woodstock* (2017)

I've been hearing about Portugal. The Man for years now. I kept meaning to check them out, but I knew nothing about them, not a thing. But I've heard the name of the band enough to merit checking them out now. So I was "going in deaf" (is that the musical equivalent of "going in blind"?).

Starting *Waiter: "You Vultures!"*, I was immediately impressed with the first track, "How the Leopard Got Its Spots". The music was good, and I quickly thought "she can really sing". Which made me think, "what a clever name, a female led band, and they put 'The Man' in the name of the band". Not since a few years ago when I learned about a future band on my list have I been so surprised (you'll have to wait until week 46 to find out who) about the gender of a singer. So, yeah, a few songs later I started to wonder more, and looked it up - and yes, the lead vocalist for Portugal. The Man is indeed not a woman, but a man, with one hell of a falsetto. Re-listening to the song later, I'm still impressed, and somewhat can't believe it. Amazing range.

There was a lot I liked in *Waiter: "You Vultures!"*. There is a raw-ness to this album that I really dig, and the music is strong throughout. Most tracks worked for me because of a strong mix of guitar/bass/drums that were complemented very well with the vocals, and the mix of acoustic and electric guitar was very well done. Some of my favorite songs were "How the Leopard Got Its Spots", "Gold Fronts", "Waiter" (a song that starts out so simple, and then kicks in great around the 2 minute mark), and "Bad Bad Levi Brown". Outside of "Guns. Guns...Guns" going on about 4 minutes too long, this was a solid first album that I enjoyed.

Unfortunately, things started to trend away from what I like about the band after this album. As they evolved, they seemed to lose the rawness, the grit, that I liked most in *Waiter: "You Vultures!"*. *The Satanic Satanist* kept some of what I liked, and - to be fair - added some new things I liked as well. "People Say" had some really great guitar and drum work that I liked, which set a strong mood for the song. "Lovers in Love" is driven by a great bass line, and the music/vocals work well together. "The Woods" starts off with a great beat, which carries the song. And several songs have some good tempo changes ("People Say", "The Sun", "Do You"). But the album didn't keep my attention the way *Waiter: "You Vultures!"* did; I felt like many songs on *The Satanic Satanist* lacked a "punch" that songs on the previous album had.

The trend continued on the next two albums - again, while there were a few songs I liked, and a few parts of other songs that I liked, both *In the Mountain in the Cloud* and *Evil Friends* lost me - and even bored me at times. And this was in spite of me noticing more keyboard, strings, and saxophone playing in those albums. Those were some of my favorite parts, but often these instruments would just make a cameo in a song, or weren't given enough of a presence within the song.

I'm not going to go through all the little things I liked here and there, but I can't pass through these albums without talking about "Waves". The piano/guitar intro gets what I'm looking for, and then the percussion starts, followed immediately by the vocals, and the mood of the song is fully established - and I'm here for it. Then, we get to the tempo change in the chorus—with some great guitar playing—and the song transforms itself for a bit. It almost feels like a song that belongs on one of the first two albums, feeling out of place in a good way for me.

Finally, I got to their breakout album, *Woodstock*. In some ways, I felt like this was a return to some of what I liked more from their earlier work - but it also evolved more new things that I liked. The hit song, the one I knew (but didn't know it was their song) is the very catchy "Feel It Still". You've heard it, everyone's heard it, it was everywhere when it came out. For me, this is a "feel" album. The album didn't have any other songs that really jumped out at me, but the feel of the entire album mostly worked for me (with a few outliers near the end). But it starts out strong, with "Number One", "Easy Tiger", and "Feel It Still" all establishing strong musical moods that I enjoyed. "Keep On" (which, for half a second, I thought was "Song 2" by Blur) has a great beat from the bass/guitar, and has tempo changes that I really enjoyed (especially when the music kicks in at the one-minute mark), and was my favorite song on the album. Things fall off a little bit for a few songs, but "Tidal Wave" has a nice groove to it that pulled me back into the album. A nice bounce back after a couple of albums that didn't really work for me.

Despite all that I did like this week, it was a bit disappointing to come away from this with a feeling of "great, I'm done with them". It wasn't The Kinks or Chance the Rapper relief, but I was ready to be done when I was done - unlike some weeks where I know it's time to move on, but I look forward to a future where I get to explore an artist more and/or re-visit what I liked again.

I get the sense that some more time paying attention to lyrics this week would increase my enjoyment, and I get that people love the activism that makes its way into their music - but I just don't have the desire to do it. I contrast it to someone like Tracy Chapman, who drew me into her lyrics (and activism) on first listen, and further listening made those things stand out more - and it makes me not want to have to "work too hard" to like/appreciate what an artist is doing. I think what I'm trying to say is that I realize that there might be more depth here, but I wasn't given enough to want to explore further to find it.

* Favorite song: It didn't take too long for me to find this, "How the Leopard Got Its Spots" takes it with the first song. "Waves" gave it a run for its money, but the flow and feel is so good, the music and vocals complement each other so well, the guitar intro is really good (and even better at the end), and the tempo changes at the one-minute and again at the 2.5-minute mark seal the deal for me.
* Favorite album: *Waiter: "You Vultures!"* gets this, and unlike weeks like with [Aimee Mann](https://barrylliumlabs.com/music/post.html?file=week4-AimeeMann.md), it's not because it was my favorite of a bunch of albums I really liked, it was because for me, they peaked for me early and never quite got back to where they started.

Next week, I hit the halfway point (six months done!) of my project with Godfather of Soul, James Brown.
