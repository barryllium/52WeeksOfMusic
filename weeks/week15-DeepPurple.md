Three weeks ago, I was listening to Black Sabbath, and was pleasantly surprised both by how much I liked them, and by how much they were not what I thought they would be. This week, I find myself listening to Deep Purple, a contemporary of Black Sabbath, who took rock in a different (yet still influential) direction. And once again, I found myself surprised. The playlist:

- "Hush" (1968)
- "Mandrake Root" (1968)
- *Deep Purple in Rock* (1970)
- "Black Night" (1970)
- *Fireball* (1971)
- "Strange Kind of Woman" (1971)
- *Machine Head* (1972)
- *Made in Japan (Live)* (1972)
- *Who Do We Think We Are* (1973) <small>second listen only</small>
- *Burn* (1974)
- *Perfect Strangers* (1984) <small>second listen only</small>

I liked "Hush" a lot, and I was almost taken aback by the keyboard<sup>1</sup> work. It was really good, and not something that I usually hear (or perhaps notice as much) in the music I listen to - outside of artists like Ben Folds or Will Wood who use the keyboard as a focal point of their music. And along with the keyboard, the guitar work was excellent, and the drum work was really good as well. And I really liked Rod Evans' vocal work, he fit in really well with the band.

Rod Evans, though, was a one song deal in my playlist, as Ian Gillan takes over in "Mandrake Root" and is there most of the rest of the way. While "Mandrake Root" has some really great instrumental work, I can't say the vocals did much for me, and the song went on a little long for my taste.

Next up was *Deep Purple in Rock*. I _really_ liked this album. At the soul of the entire album, and at the heart and soul of the album is the keyboard/guitar duo of Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore. All of the musicians do a great job, but I don't really have words for how engaging both of them are, true masters at their craft. The way they play off of each other in "Speed King" is fantastic, and the keyboard work in "Child in Time" takes that from a good song to a great song. Ian Gillan does his best with the vocals, and truly adds something to "Child in Time" and "Living Wreck", two of my favorite songs on this album.

The whole band brings it together again for the single version of "Black Night", where Gillan's vocal work really compliments the instrumental work, with some next level guitar work. Sometimes I hear someone play the guitar and I think "I wish I could play guitar at all, let alone that well". And sometimes I hear songs like this and think "I could never play guitar that well".

*Fireball*, though, was a notable downturn for the band for me. For half the album, I almost felt like the musicians were being purposefully muted, and Gillan's vocal track was being made more prominent - and it really didn't work for me. In fact, from this point on, I more often than not found Gillan's work to detract from the music. There continues to be some great guitar work, the keyboard pretty much always works for me (especially in "Anyone's Daughter" and "The Mule"). But Gillan's vocal work just always felt lacking. Sometimes it felt forced, other times it felt inauthentic, but more often than not it ended up feeling like he was performing over just singing. It's almost as if he knew the talent he was surrounded by, and just doing anything he could to try to raise himself to that level - a tough goal, and one he rarely met for me.

Many of these feelings continue through "Strange Kind of Woman", where I found myself wanting the song to punch up to a different level, but it just never quite got there.

*Machine Head* brought back some of the magic of *Deep Purple in Rock*, thankfully. The instrumental work in *Highway Star* engaged me, my whole body was responding to the music - and Gillan holds his own through most of the song (until he starts screaming). The first time through *Highway Star*, I realized how Lord's keyboard work made me think of The Doors and their use of keyboards, and it made me fall in love with Lord's work even more.

The guitar work stands out more often than not in *Machine Head* as well - the number of songs where I was drawn in by the guitar intro is almost equal to the number of songs on the album. "Pictures of Home" evokes a Blues atmosphere with the guitar work, and "Lazy" has a great intro. And the standout, of course, is "Smoke on the Water" (the one song I knew before this week, but didn't know it was Deep Purple). The way the song starts is magical: first you just get just the guitar riff, then the drums are incrementally added in, followed by the bass, and finally with the vocals and keyboard - it's magic. It's honestly a "stop what you are doing and listen" intro to a song, that flows well through the entire song.

Two patterns started to stick out to me in *Machine Head*, though. For one, Gillan's vocal work felt like a detraction and distraction to me more often than not. Not every song, but with songs like "Lazy", I feel like it would have been notably better as just an instrumental track. And secondly, there are a couple of songs that just go on a bit long. I love a good instrumental break, but at some point a song ends up feeling a bit self-indulgent when it goes on too long. Some Deep Purple songs push that limit for me, and some end up going well past it. Which brings us perfectly to...

*Made in Japan*. I have some very good things to say about this album, but the instrumental breaks are extended to the max. I'm famously on record (in my head, because I've never actually said this to someone out loud) as not liking jam bands like Phish or Goose. I like lyrics - I like how they add levels to a song. That's not to say that lyrics are essential to me, but most of the time they are a positive addition to a song that I really want. So when a song like "Space Truckin'" more than doubles in length for a concert, I honestly just get bored and start to tune it out. While the too-long instrumental breaks weren't solely on *Made in Japan*, they were most evident there.

With that said, the live album also delivers a lot. Gillan actually sounds better on this album (most of the time), and there are a handful of songs - "Highway Star", "Child in Time", "The Mule", and "Strange Kind of Woman" where I prefer the live version. Sure, some of those songs go on longer, and I wish they didn't, but Gillan sounds better in them, and the instrumental work feels even bigger, more powerful, and I found myself more drawn to those versions.

My first time through, I listened to *Burn* next. The band temporarily moves on from Ian Gillan and replaces him with David Coverdale - to mild improvements. In songs like "Sail Away", Coverdale seems like a marked improvement, and the harmonies in "Might Just Take Your Life" and "You Fool No One" sound good. But in other songs, namely "What's Goin' On Here" and "Lay Down Stay Down", I have the same misgivings about Coverdale that I did about Gillan. With all that said, "Sail Away" and "Mistreated" were two of my favorite songs of the week, so this album delivers in that sense.

I'm going to go ahead and lump *Who Do We Think We Are* and *Perfect Strangers* together. And I'll start with the positives: still great instrumental work in both albums. The middle third of "A Gypsy's Kiss" was awesome, even if I have **zero** idea what the hell is going on with the lyrics in that song. "Wasted Sunset" had a real Bon Jovi vibe to the intro, and the guitar work in the middle third somehow manages to be both understated and impressive at the same time (it was easily my favorite song across both albums). The bass work (I think it was the bass?) in "Hungry Daze" is fantastic, it almost sounded like an upright bass or a cello, and it added a dimension to the song.

But, the rest of both those albums just did not work for me. For starters, I came to the realization that Gillan must have been the inspiration for [Limozeen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqXO05U_56w). But more than that, I just don't need to listen to two entire albums about a guy either singing about wanting to get laid, complaining about women, or complaining about women that won't help him get laid. If that means I've turned into [Krusty the Clown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1C1skbNco&t=11s) in my old age, so be it.

So how do I feel after a week of Deep Purple, you ask? First of all, thank you for asking, I really appreciate it. Secondly, I find myself contemplating how time and comparison are interesting things. How would I feel about Deep Purple if I hadn't listened to Black Sabbath three weeks ago? Ozzy brings charisma and an identity to Black Sabbath in a way that Gillan fails repeatedly with Deep Purple. That comparison definitely affected how I listened to Deep Purple. Also affecting how I listened this week was a lifetime of listening to evolutions on what Deep Purple did. I've listened to a lot Metallica, Alice in Chains, and other artists that were influenced by Deep Purple. So many of the things that Deep Purple did that might have been groundbreaking at the time, were already familiar to me. This was both positive and negative, because I think it probably lessened the impact of Deep Purple's music on me in a way I will never know or understand.

Even with all the questions I'm left with, the highs were still so high this week. The keyboard work was the number one highlight, it took me by surprise early and never disappointed, to the point where I would get excited halfway through a song when Lord would start accompanying or soloing, because he is just so good at what he does. And Blackmore's guitar work was often enough to elevate a song to a new level, even where lyrics and vocals left me feeling disconnected from the music.

- Favorite song: perhaps it's familiarity, but the intro to "Smoke on the Water" wins it for me. The entire song is great, but the build up sets the tone for it perfectly. I guess there is a reason, sometimes, why a song lives on as long as it does in the zeitgeist.
- Favorite album: easily *Deep Purple in Rock*. In a sea of great guitar and keyboard work, this has some of the best and most consistently good work throughout, and Gillan works better on this album than most.

Next up - Tracy Chapman
