When Patti Smith rocks, she rocks.

I could sum most of this week up with just that statement - if it’s a rock (or punk) song, there was a good chance I would like it. And for the most part, her more melodramatic songs, her ballads, and her “spoken word-ish” songs just bounced right off of me. Before we go any further, this week’s playlist:

* *Horses* (1975)
* *Radio Ethiopia* (1976)
* *Easter* (1978)
* *Wave* (1979)
* *Dream of Life* (1988)
* *Gone Again* (1996) <small>second playthrough only</small>
* *Gung Ho* (2000) <small>second playthrough only</small>
  * "Glitter in Their Eyes"
  * "Strange Messengers"
* *Trampin’* (2004) <small>second playthrough only</small>
  * "Peaceable Kingdom"
  * "Jubilee"

It was an interesting week, starting off with *Horses*. The first time around, it took me a few songs to get into the album, and I wasn’t sure what to think. I thought for sure I would love Patti Smith, since I knew many artists I like a lot were influenced by her and many have even cited her importance to them. So when, a few songs in, I had mixed feelings, I started to worry I had another John Coltrane or Jack White on my hands here. Thankfully, “Break It Up” came along and, well, broke up my confusion. I loved this song - it’s powerful, the music is great, and the emotions come through with the vocal performance (and yes, required weekly comment about loving the piano work in a song). “Land” had some great guitar work and the tempo changes kept drawing me in - though it did go on a bit long in the end. But the album ended on a winner for me - "Elegie" was profound, entrancing, and somehow both sad and beautiful. The guitar work and vocals really brought the song together for me.

*Radio Ethiopia* went back and forth for me. “Ask the Angels” has some next-level guitar work (and is pretty damn catchy), but then “Ain’t It Strange” delivers on the name by being very strange for its second half (is she speaking in tongues?). The album lives in a state of “this is interesting, but not great” for a few songs, but then “Pissing in a River” and “Pumping” deliver some fantastic rock energy. Both have vocals and music that work perfectly together, and “Pissing in a River” has strong emotion throughout. And the buildup in the middle third of “Pumping” kept dragging me into the song more and more (in a good way). “Distant Fingers” isn’t quite on the level of the previous two songs, and I’d probably have more things to say about it if it weren’t preceded by two stellar songs.

The album ends on a weird note, though. I don’t have strong feelings about “Radio Ethiopia”, it starts out strong but gets weird and goes on too long - to feed directly into whatever the hell “Abyssinia” is. Both times through I had a “what did I just listen to” feeling, not the way I want to finish out an album, ever.

*Easter* starts off strong with “Till Victory” and “Space Monkey”, building up to the one song I knew before this week in “Because the Night”. Listening to it, I have zero questions about how this song has lived on for decades - everything comes together: vocals and music work so well together, the energy of the song is fantastic, and the tempo/rhythm changes keep taking me to new places in the song in a way that I love.

The middle of this album is “just ok” for me, and there is obviously the [controversial track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_N_Roll_Nigger) that I’ll be honest, I’m just not the right person to say anything about. Things pick up a bit with “Privilege (Set Me Free)”, which has some solid music and good tempo changes. But “We Three” is the other hit for me on this album. The vocals are so emotional and heartfelt, and the music fits the mood of the song so well - you can feel the troubled emotions through the entire song.

“25th Floor” starts out great as well, with some guitar work that I really liked… but then it pretty much turned into spoken word (which continued through "High on Rebellion") that I just didn’t like. “Easter” picks things back up again for a bit with a simplistic guitar/percussion arrangement combined with some great vocals, until it again slips back into spoken word for the final third - making it the second album in a row that felt like a letdown of an ending.

*Wave* was an interesting album for me. After my first playthrough, I felt like it was one of my favorite albums of the week, despite not having a lot of specific songs that I could point to in order to explain why. After my second listen I was able to point to “So You Want to Be” and “Citizen Ship” as having great rock vocals and music, both songs really feeling like quintessential late 70s rock songs. The guitar intro to "Revenge" made me think of Aerosmith (specifically “Last Child”), which is never a bad thing for me. But the rest of the album just didn’t jump out at me - for good or bad reasons. I think the reason I felt like I liked it more the first time around is that it didn’t have the letdown of an ending some other albums do, but conversely, it doesn’t do “as much good stuff” as some of the other albums. The good songs felt very good - but not quite great - and the worst songs were still ok, so that left it sitting higher in my esteem after just one listen.

I will not spend a lot of time on *Dream of Life*, *Gone Again*, or the singles from *Gung Ho* or *Trampin’*. These albums, overall, were just not going for something that I want. Sometimes the songs just felt too sleepy. Other songs felt like they were building to something, but never finished building. There are some moments in “People Have the Power”, “Going Under”, “Dream of Life”, “Gone Again”, and “Glitter in Their Eyes”, but unfortunately those moments didn’t even last for the whole song, let alone their respective albums.

It’s weird coming off the last few weeks, where I had two artists (Tracy Chapman and Wilco) that really drew me in with their lyrics + artistry, and then Jack White who made me angry at his music more than he made me like it. I came into this with a bit of a comparison. I was worried at times that I was going to feel similarly about Patti Smith as I did to Jack White, but the truth is that she never made me want to turn her music off - she just had some songs that bounced off of me.

The more interesting comparison was to Tracy Chapman and Wilco, though. In very few of Patti’s songs did I get drawn in by the lyrics. In fact, sometimes the music and vocal performance made the actual lyrics feel either trivial or even impenetrable. Outside of a handful of songs, I was looking at the lyrics in an effort to make myself care about a song more, or because I just could not understand the lyrics. I much prefer when I’m looking at them because a particular lyric really catches my ear (like it did in “We Three”, and many times in previous weeks), but that just wasn’t happening most of the time.

At some points this week, I started asking myself “do I like the right Patti Smith?”, because this is a woman who spanned multiple decades in her career, and is widely loved and cited - and here I am just not getting into half her career. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it was her early career that I was drawn to - and that’s where she revolutionized the industry by establishing American Punk. I felt like if I had just stuck to listening to her earlier work (anything pre-80s), I would be coming out of this feeling like there was a great chance I’d like almost everything she put out. Those albums weren’t perfect, but the highs were pretty high.

* Favorite Album: This is a tough one, but in the end I think it comes down to *Horses*. This album rose up a lot on my second playthrough, some of the songs I “just didn’t get” settled in more with me the next time around, and of all her albums it ends the strongest for me. *Easter* might have taken this if it weren’t for a lull in the middle and a letdown of an ending.
* Favorite Song: Another tough one, because the songs I liked I *really* liked. “Because the Night” is so good, and “We Three” brings so much emotion to the table. “Pissing in a River” and “Pumping” are a dynamic back-to-back duo. But I just have to give this to “Break It Up”. When the song is finished, I just want to play it again. It has a bit of “*je ne sais quoi*” to it, but I really like this song.

I exit a week where I felt certain I was going to love the artist, and then went on a journey. Now I enter a week where, after [week 10](https://barrylliumlabs.com/music/post.html?file=week10-JohnColtrane.md), I’m worried I’m going to have a bad time. What do you have for me, Miles Davis?
