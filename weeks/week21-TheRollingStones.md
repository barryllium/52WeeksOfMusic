When I was a kid, the local classic rock radio station (103.9 The Edge) had this TV commercial that I loved. It had nothing to do with the visuals (which were a guy throwing paint around), but the song: "I see a red door and I want it painted black...". I only heard 30 seconds of the song, but I really liked it. Of course, with no internet, there was no "let me just DuckDuckGo those lyrics" available to me, so I just knew the song sounded very cool. Later in life, of course, I learned this was the Rolling Stones. But even though I liked the few songs I knew about them, this was the first time I really dove deep into their music.

I was treated to a great start with the all-time classic songs of "(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction", and then *Aftermath* starting with "Paint It Black". Almost spoiled, really. I'm not saying anything groundbreaking by saying that two songs that have persisted through decades are good songs. Both songs have amazing intros, with "Satisfaction" using distortion to an awesome effect with the guitar intro; "Paint It Black" has such a unique combo of a sitar leading into drums, and the guitar/drums combo is great throughout, combined with some great tempo changes. 30 years later for me, and I still really like "Paint It Black"

*Aftermath* overall was a solid first album for my week. It peaks early with "Paint It Black", followed by "Stupid Girl" and "Lady Jane", and while the album is solid throughout, it doesn't quite reach the heights of how it starts. It does, however, display a number of interesting combinations of unusual instruments, something that became a big theme for me this week.

Next up was "She's a Rainbow", a song I first heard in an [iMac commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZv4Ok4rlc). This is a wonderful song, and I love it. The piano is fantastic through the whole song, the harpsichord is unique and works well, and the violins/violas/cellos (apparently from a mellotron?) really work. The vocals work great with the music, and I can't find anything wrong with it.

I'm going to skip ahead in time to *Goats Head Soup*, *Some Girls*, and *Tattoo You*. These albums all have some songs that I really liked ("Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker)", "Angie", "Miss You", "Beast of Burden", "Start Me Up", and "Worried About You" to name some of the highlights). But, compared to the four-album stretch I'm about to talk about, something is missing. I can't even really quantify it - but these albums just don't do it for me as much. *Goats Head Soup* and *Some Girls* are more consistent, and still have some of the same energy and feel of the previous albums, but *Tattoo You* mostly felt like a letdown despite a few highs. But at least it gave us [this commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRdl1BjTG7c), the first time I ever heard "Start Me Up".

But let's not focus on "the lesser albums". *Beggars Banquet*, *Let It Bleed*, *Sticky Fingers*, and *Exile on Main Street* are one hell of a four-album run. And I'm not alone in saying that - in what little research I did after my playthrough, the consensus is that it's one of the best four-album runs ever. This made sense to me, because it was a run of albums that I liked the first time around, and liked even more the second time around.

I feel like I'm simultaneously not going to do these albums justice, and also be a little hyperbolic. These aren't even perfect albums - each one has a song or two that either washed right past me or that I actively didn't like, usually when the songs lean more towards the band's country tendencies. But there are so many good things in these albums that they deserve the credit they get.

There are so many things that stuck out to me in these albums. One common theme, which should be no shock if you've been reading me since Deep Purple week, is the piano. Whether it's "Sympathy for the Devil", "Jigsaw Puzzle", "Gimme Shelter", "Sister Morphine", "Let It Loose", or a dozen other songs, the piano was either the star or the glue for so many songs. I love a good piano, and the Stones had it in spades.

Pro tip for any band that wants me to like their song - create a musical buildup where instruments come in one at a time. It's the buildup to the middle third of "You Can't Always Get What You Want". The start of "Sister Morphine" going from just guitar, adding the slide guitar, then the bass. The stripped down piano/vocals opening of "Shine A Light" that then gets accompanied by more instruments over time. I love when songs do this well, and the Stones did it time and time again.

Of course I have to point to Mick Jagger's vocal performances. In some ways, it snuck up on me. The handful of songs where Keith Richards was on lead vocals, it struck me how much I missed Jagger. Sometimes his voice is the focus, and his charismatic presence brought a song to a new level - like "You Can't Always Get What You Want" or "Brown Sugar". Other times he brings the musical arrangement together, like "Wild Horses" or "No Expectations". But it worked for me in both situations, and felt like a key part to the music - especially when it wasn't there.

And then there are the guitars. So many guitars — electric, acoustic, slide, 12-string, distorted, clean — but what really worked for me was how rarely they felt like the point of the song. Sometimes the guitar was the star, like the grit of "Stray Cat Blues" or the next-level playing at the end of "Sway." Other times it was about restraint and texture, like the acoustic work in "Wild Horses" or the way the slide guitar in "Sister Morphine" waits its turn before completely changing the feel of the song. Even when the guitar playing was aggressive or front-and-center, it usually felt in service of the arrangement rather than indulgent. I found myself appreciating the guitars most when they added mood, tension, or momentum — working alongside piano, drums, and vocals — instead of trying to dominate them. That balance is a big part of why so many of these songs clicked for me.

And then we get to all the other instruments. Harmonica almost [changed my relationship with the piano](https://i.imgflip.com/afe6c5.jpg) this week. "Shake Your Hips", "Stop Breaking Down", and "Midnight Rambler" all had some notable harmonica work, and the harmonica was a huge part of "Miss You" (from *Some Girls*, but still!) being among my favorite songs of the week. Then we have the strings - like the upright bass in "Moonlight Mile", the violin in "Factory Girl" and "Love in Vain", and the violins/violas/cellos in "Sway". The big band feel brought by the trumpets, trombones, and saxophone in songs like "Bitch", "Rocks Off", and "All Down the Line". So many instruments, all used in interesting and effective ways.

While experiencing all of these things, I kept asking myself what - in retrospect - feels like a very dumb question: "Why don't more bands do these things?". I mostly was wondering why more groups didn't effectively bring in more instruments, and do interesting things with them. But isn't that part of the genius here, part of what sets the Rolling Stones apart? Not everyone can put together a dozen artists and make that really work. Not everyone can have three different guitarists each playing 2-3 different kinds of guitars and do that well. Not everyone has the charismatic voice of Mick Jagger. The Rolling Stones did, and that's what makes their music so good to me.

* Favorite Album: Hard to pick from the four-album stretch, but *Sticky Fingers* takes this for me. A tone is set from the first notes of "Brown Sugar", and "Wild Horses" is a great song. Add in other songs that I really liked ("Sway", "I Got the Blues", "Sister Morphine"), and this album comes out on top of a great group of albums.
* Favorite Song: Not hard to choose, actually - despite there being many great songs to choose from. "She's a Rainbow" just makes me happy when I hear it, and what more can you ask from in a song? The piano is fantastic, the buildup to the first lyrics is awesome, and the strings bring the song home. Love it.

After finally diving into the Rolling Stones, I don't go too far geographically next week with another British group - one that as far as I know I have never heard a song from - The Smiths.
