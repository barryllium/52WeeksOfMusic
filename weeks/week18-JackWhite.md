How do I feel about Jack White, you ask? Thank you for asking — and I’ll answer your question with a question: Which Jack White?

I came into this week vaguely familiar with Jack White, and had a feeling that I wasn’t going to like him. I was aware of the White Stripes, and I liked “Seven Nation Army”. And that was all I knew, other than something I must have heard at some point, something I can’t remember, that made me think I wouldn’t really like him. And then I listened to the following playlist:

- *Blunderbuss* (2012)
- *Lazaretto* (2014)
- *Boarding House Reach* (2018)
- *Fear of the Dawn* (2022)
- *Entering Heaven Alive* (2022)
- *No Name* (2024) <small>second listen only</small>

From album to album, I felt like I was hearing two different artists - a genre-blending artist, and a chaotic noise engineer. One of these I sort of like. The other I actively do not.

#### The Jack White I kind of like - The Artist

This is where *Blunderbuss* and *Entering Heaven Alive* fit. There’s some folk, some punk, some rock. Sometimes even a little bit country. It’s all over the place, but each song seems to have an identity. And that’s not to say that I love everything - sometimes Jack’s voice doesn’t work for me (it gets a bit screechy at times) - but I find a lot of the songs *interesting*. There is a lot of piano work that I liked, in “Missing Pieces”, “Hypocritical Kiss”, “Weep Themselves to Sleep”, and “Trash Tongue Talker”.  After listening to Tracy Chapman and Wilco for the last few weeks, I’m finding myself drawn to acoustic guitar lately; “Love Interruption”, “All Along The Way”, and “Taking Me Back (Gently)” delivered on that front.

There were some really great background vocals on many tracks (too many to list) that really gave the tracks texture. Country is usually anathema to me, but some of the vocalists had a definitive country tone to them, and I almost always enjoyed it. Whether they worked with the music or juxtaposed against it, I liked what it brought to the song. Add in the wide array of instruments used from song to song - some songs tallying close to a dozen performers playing one or more instruments - and even if I didn’t love a song, I found it interesting.

#### The Jack White I hate - The Chaos Engineer

And then we have the other version of Jack White, who I’d love to call Jack Black, but that name’s already taken. This applied to most of the songs in *Lazaretto*, *Boarding House Reach*, *Fear Of The Dawn*, and *No Name*. While *Lazaretto* and *No Name* did have a few songs I appreciated, there were as many (*or more*) songs that I actively hated. Here are some of my grievances:

- Some songs would start out great, but then a synthesizer would start playing and make me hate the song. Special shout out to “Into the Twilight” for ruining itself with the synth and what I can only describe as “Meeples” singing.
- Others of his songs felt loud just to be loud - in ways that some of the music was so loud that it made the vocals impossible to hear or even care about.
- Then there are the songs that can’t decide on a genre and feel like they don’t know what they are trying to do.
- Some songs were really bad spoken word - one song even started as bad spoken word and turned into a Zoom call where someone has a bad connection and their voice turns into a robot (“Get in the Mind Shaft”).
- “Hi-De-Ho” confuses me into how it even exists, or what it even is.
- “Hypermisophoniac” hurt my brain. And my notes say, verbatim: “‘Everything You’ve Ever Learned’ is just stupid”.

With all that said, there were a few songs that I did like on these albums, so I don’t want to give them short shrift. There were some great instrumental combinations in “Would You Fight for My Love?”. “Just One Drink” and “Alone in My Home” both had a good combination of good music and background vocals. “Humoresque” was a nice purposefully understated song. “Shedding My Velvet” was my favorite song on all three of these albums combined, and it wasn’t close. It felt unique, and the late piano work was fantastic.

But those good songs were the exception on these albums, not the rule. I’m all for artists trying something experimental and pushing the envelope, but whatever Jack was trying to do in these albums, most of it just didn’t work for me, and some of it actively turned me against it.

#### Where this leaves me

If I take a step back from it all, I have to hand it to Jack White as being a *very* talented musician. He plays countless different instruments, and while I don’t always like his voice, he can definitely sing. When his voice works, it has character to it almost (but not quite) in the vein of Ozzy Osbourne. It’s distinctive and strong, and adds flavor to his music. Conversely, sometimes his voice grates at me a bit (especially when he auto-tunes it or puts some sort of effect on it) - but overall, there is a lot of talent there. Sometimes I’d like a song where he does half a dozen things, and other times I’d hate those songs. I’d listen to one song where he had 8 performers playing/singing with him and think that was better, and then the next song would be the same and I’d hate it. I struggled to find a pattern, which leaves me at the end of this week feeling very “meh” about his work as a whole.

- Favorite album: I didn’t specifically talk about it much, because it dominates these categories, but *Entering Heaven Alive* is an album I would consider revisiting. It is the *only* album from this week to have songs compete for my favorite song of the week (one of two albums to even submit a candidate, even). *Blunderbuss* might somehow be the more interesting album (and fits my number of performers rule even better), but the highs were higher on this album.
- Favorite song: I *think* this goes to “A Tip From You to Me”. I say *think* because I also did really like “Love is Selfish” and “If I Die Tomorrow” from that same album, as well as “Shedding My Velvet”. And I don’t even have much of a quantifiable reason for why these are my favorite songs outside of 1) they didn’t do anything to make me actively hate them like a lot of other songs did; and 2) I just liked the general feel of them. But I do know that I enjoyed listening to these songs, and during a week when the majority of the songs fit into a category of “this is fine”, those songs grabbed my attention in a good way.

Hopefully next week I can feel a bit more in tune with Patti Smith.
