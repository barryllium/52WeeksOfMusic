"I think I don't like the Kinks."

That's one of the first things I wrote in my notes while listening through most of their very large discography. I want to be very clear about things - I'm not judging any of the musicians I'm exploring as objectively good or bad; instead, this is about whether or not I enjoy the music.

The Kinks have made *a lot* of music over the years. Singles, EPs, albums - *waaay* too much to listen to over the course of a week, especially when I'm trying to listen to everything twice. So I went to my good friend ChatGPT and asked for the essentials. It gave me a list of early singles, and then a number of albums. I took that information, added a few other albums to close some of the year gaps, and started listening. In my first run through, I ended up listening to a few early singles, and then the following albums:

* *The Kink Kontroversy*
* *Face to Face*
* *Something Else By the Kinks*
* *The Kinks are the Village Green Preservation Society*
* *Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One*
* *Muswell Hillbillies*
* *Sleepwalker*
* *Low Budget*

Turns out, that's still a lot of music - and unlike last week when I listened to each Billie Eilish album 7-8 times, I only made it through twice (more on that later). But, as I found myself somewhere halfway through *Something Else By the Kinks* and I was really questioning what I was doing here, and that's when I wrote "I think I don't like the Kinks" in my notes. I wasn't enjoying what I was hearing, and little did I know it was going to get worse for me soon.

Let's go back to the beginning, though. Things actually started off pretty well - "You Really Got Me" and "All Day and All of the Night" were the first two songs I listened to, and in both cases, I thought - "Oh, I like this song, I didn't know this was the Kinks!". I thought things were going to go well, and that continued through a few more singles that I thought were solid, but not on the level of the first two. And then, at least on my first listen through, things started downhill.

I'll give some credit where it's due - on my second listen, *The Kink Kontroversy* mostly worked for me. I didn't love it, but I found myself getting into it. But it ended there for several albums. *Face to Face* had one song - "Sunny Afternoon" - that was a bit catchy, but I just kept waiting for the current song to finish to see how I felt about the next song.

*Something Else By the Kinks* didn't fare well for me on either listen, I just could not get into it, and noticed a general sense of boredom with it the second time through. But this album was ready to be topped, and it happened quickly. I'll quote my notes: "What the fuck is happening during 'The Village Green Preservation Society'?". Why are they singing about Donald Duck? None of it made sense to me, and the song - and the album as a whole - felt like it was genuinely trying to kick me out of the music. It really came to a head when I wrote "Seriously, wtf is Phenomenal Cat?" in my notes. That song may perpetually live in my bottom 10, and that's coming from a person who has purposefully listened to "Kitty" by *The Presidents of the United States* on multiple occasions in his life. I wanted to quit on the Kinks both times listening to this song/album.

Thankfully, things got better. Listening to *Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One*, "Lola" was the one Kinks song, when I started this, that I knew that I knew. It's a good song. I can't say I love it, but I enjoy it enough that the familiarity helped me continue listening. And, on my second listen, I actually like "Powerman", and felt like the album started out strong as a whole. But "Apeman" feels like a *Raffi* song to me, and that's not what I'm looking for in my music.

Muswell Hillbillies finally had a few songs that I genuinely enjoyed both times. "20th Century Man" is a good start, followed by a handful of songs that bounced off of me. But I really liked "Holloway Jail" and "Oklahoma USA", and then the Ray Davies 2022 remix of "20th Century Man" made me appreciate that song even more.

Even though things were improving, I still was looking forward to finishing my first run-through of the Kinks. And at this point, I'll just share directly from my notes listening to *Sleepwalker*

* "Digging the start of Sleepwalker"
* "Yeah, what the fuck? I've trudged through albums of not liking much of anything, and now I really like Sleepwalker?!"

*Sleepwalker is the album I didn't realize I hoped I was getting after listening to *The Kinks'* early singles. It's what I wasn't getting for almost all of every album leading up to it. I don't know why, but Sleepwalker is my kind of album. If you told me they had a different band member and that made the difference, I'd believe you. I just know I really liked the album, and found myself comparing everything else to it after listening to it.

And how did the rest stack up? *Low Budget* is no *Sleepwalker*, but it still had some of the grit that I liked in it. "Little Bit of Emotion" caught me both times I listened to it, I loved the depth of it, drew me in. And after finishing *Low Budget*, I asked ChatGPT if there were other albums I didn't listen to that were like *Sleepwalker*, and ended up adding *Misfits* to my second run. I liked *Misfits* as a whole, though I can't say that some of the songs necessarily aged well (if they even played well at the time). It felt problematic, but I'll take problematic over boring and/or confounding any day.

By the time I finished my second run, and then listened to a few individual tracks again, my final thoughts are:

* *Sleepwalker* was easily my favorite album, no question.
* "All Day and All of the Night" is probably my favorite song, the familiarity helps there. "You Really Got Me" is a close second, and I think if I listened to *Sleepwalker* even more, there are a few tracks that might take over.
* To amend how I started this post, I still think I don't like the Kinks, but there are some Kinks songs that I do really like.

Next up... Aimee Mann
