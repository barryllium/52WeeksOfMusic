- *Note: I did not listen to André 1 - André 2999 before listening to OutKast*

This week did not go as expected. I knew a few OutKast songs (“Rosa Parks”, “Hey Ya”, “B.O.B”), and I thought I knew what I was getting into. I did not expect how things started out at all. Here's this week's playlist:

- *Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik* (1994)
- *ATLiens* (1996)
- *Aquemini* (1998)
- *Stankonia* (2000)
- *Speakerboxxx/The Love Below* (2003)
- *Idlewild* (2006)

Southern rap. No part of me saw this coming. I grew up in a Midwest town, to an upper-middle class family. There was little I could identify with in the first few albums. So I sat there listening with mixed feelings, thinking things like “should I even be listening to this? It clearly was not made for me”.  But I also found myself getting into the groove, loving the beat of several songs. Songs like “Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik” and “Crumblin’ Erb” really caught my attention and worked their way into my bones. Turns out, great music is great music, regardless of “who it is written for”.  And this took me back <cue Scooby Doo style flashback…>

The year is [2000](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kmzpdd4pWvM). Ice Cube has put out *War & Peace, Vol. 2 (The Peace Disc)*. And for whatever reason, this and Vol. 1 made their way into my musical lexicon. One song, in particular, will stick with me for decades. With apologies to Mr. Cube (Mr. Ice? Mr. Ice Cube?), “Roll All Day” is not a great song. It’s not even a good song. Technically it’s a song. But it’s so bad, that somehow I loved it. The chorus of “I got a full tank of unleaded” is ridonkulous, and I can only assume this song started as a joke. But, nonetheless, I rocked this album, and especially this song. Ok, I probably didn’t rock anything; in the summer of 2000, though, I played this album a lot. No idea why - it didn’t fit into the rest of my musical listening at all, and within months I mostly forgot about it. That is, with the exception of "Roll All Day". It’s been 25 years since I’ve listened to that song, and yet, once or twice a year I will fill my car with gas and laugh when I think “I’ve got a full tank of unleaded”.

That brings us back to the present. Remembering the summer of 2000 helped me realize that you don’t have to “get” music, it doesn’t have to be “written for you” in order for you to enjoy it if it’s good music.

So I kept listening, and I kept enjoying the music more. By the time I got to *Aquemini*, I was definitely settling in and enjoying the southern rap beginnings of OutKast - just in time to start to hear their evolution into what I thought I’d be hearing all along. “Rosa Parks” came on, and from that point on, I was just enjoying everything without reservation. And wow did “Rosa Parks” hold up to a deep listening. The acoustic guitar work is magical, and how many different genres does this song hold in it? Rap, R&B, Jazz, and maybe even Mariachi. The song is put together both with excellence and ease, top marks.

The beat, the bass of *Aquemini* felt undeniably great to me, written and performed in a way that I could not help but unconsciously move to the music. Southern rap, playful R&B, it was all good to me. On my second listen, a lot of songs popped out for me, including both parts of “Da Art of Storytellin’,” and the album as a whole flowed so well.

And boy did last week set me up for this week. The George Clinton influence is insanely evident from *Aquemini* on. “Synthesizer” even featured Clinton, and it was one of my favorite songs on the album. And that influence shined through even more once I started *Stankonia*. And there are some serious standout songs in that album. “B.O.B. (Bombs Over Baghdad)” and “Ms. Jackson” are great, and the album as a whole flows so well. And, even though I felt bad every time, I always laughed a little at the “ha ha ha” in “We Luv Deez Hoez”. This album from start to end was full of great music, and above that, fun.

Next came *Speakerboxxx/The Love Below*, and I don’t have enough words. From the interludes to the songs, I kept thinking “I love this” in so many different ways. It was a catchy song here, and ridiculous interlude there, a moving song when I didn’t expect it, and it never disappointed. So many songs I loved for so many reasons. “The Way You Move” is catchy beyond belief. “Hey Ya” is probably their most defining song, or at least the one most people know. “Take Off Your Cool" is short, sweet, not even much of a song - but it managed to move me. Interludes like “God” crack me up every time I think of them. And we need to talk about “Rooster”.

I’ve talked a lot about how I cannot relate to the lyrics in many of OutKast’s songs. This is the major exception. Relationships? Check. Parenting? Yep. Neck and back pain? Check check check. I’ve been dealing with neck pain since I was a teenager, and back issues for a decade. My wife has had neck issues for 20 years, and her back went out a month ago and she’s still having pain. So this song came into my life and I immediately listened to it, sent it to my wife, and then started it over and listened to it again. Amazing, it had me laughing the entire time, and the music is great. This song is 🧑‍🍳👌

*Idlewild* was a solid last album. It doesn’t reach the heights of the previous two albums for me, but had a couple of songs that stood out for me: “N2u” is catchy as hell, with a great rhythm and beat, “The Train” caught me up in its groove, and “When I Look in Your Eyes” is just plain sweet.

I feel like I could keep going on about so many more things - they not only reference the music of but also have songs including artists like Killer Mike, Snoop, Cee-Lo, and the aforementioned George Clinton. Big Boi and André 3000 are definitely students of their music, and it shows.

- Favorite Song: I really want to give this to "Rooster", I really do. But, I don't know when I will stop singing "Ms. Jackson" in my head, and I don't care. This song hits on lyrics, musicality, and rhythm. I don't even know what I mean by musicality, but I know it hits on it. The "ooh" after "I'm sorry Ms. Jackson" lives rent free in my brain, and I'm ok with that.
- Favorite Album: *Speakerboxxx/The Love Below* takes it here, in no small part due to my love for "Rooster" and the "God" interlude, but amped up by a general greatness boosted even more by standouts like "Hey Ya" and "The Way You Move". Awesome album.

And that's OutKast, as I see it. Next week, something completely different - but from what little I know, still probably left his mark on innumerable artists that I've listened to: John Coltrane.

Amen

Oh, I’m sorry, I’m sorry

A-lady
