This week's music is brought to you by drugs. A lot of drugs.

* *12 Bar Bruise* (2012)
* *Oddments* (2014)
* *I'm in Your Mind Fuzz* (2014)
* *Paper Mâché Dream Balloon* (2015) <small>second playthrough only</small>
* *Nonagon Infinity* (2016)
* *Flying Microtonal Banana* (2017)
* *Polygondwanaland* (2017)

OK, I can't really back that up... but the psychedelic nature of most of this music left me with little better explanation for what I was listening to. And that's not even to say I didn't like it - because there was a lot to like - but I was often left with a "what did I just listen to" feeling.

There is an energy that I liked right from the start in *12 Bar Bruise*. Through most of the album, I constantly noted that I really liked the music. The guitar, bass, and drums were all great, and worked really well together. "Cut Throat Boogie" and "Sea of Trees" had some legitimate moments of great music, a sign of things to come for the rest of their albums. Unfortunately, the other trend that is established is that on almost every song the vocals felt like an afterthought, and the lyrics seemed like even more of one.

And despite that statement, *Oddments* was a bit of an outlier. There are a handful of songs that felt like "complete" songs to me, where the vocals and music worked well together and the lyrics felt like they were actually trying to say something. That's not to say there aren't songs that fit the pattern - "Vegemite" and "Hot Wax" might be better off without vocals at all. But songs like "It's Got Old" and "Homeless Man in Adidas" (which both gave me [Wilco](https://barrylliumlabs.com/music/post.html?file=week17-Wilco.md) vibes), as well as "Work This Time" really incorporated the vocals along with the music, and they drew me in with their "laid back" nature and vibe. And then there is "Crying", which felt like a song from a completely different band 40 years ago.

More than anything, though, *Oddments* was where I started noticing something that I asked for a [few weeks ago](https://barrylliumlabs.com/music/post.html?file=week21-TheRollingStones.md) - "Why don't more bands do these things?". Like the Rolling Stones, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard makes use of many non-standard instruments. Some strings here, often a flute (which was often the defining piece of a song), and my favorite from this week - the harmonica. Ambrose Kenny-Smith plays a mean harmonica, and boy did I love it this week. It elevated "It's Got Old" to one of my favorite songs of the week, and took "Hot Wax" from *why do they keep saying Hot Wax in this stupid song* to *lose the lyrics, the harmonica is killing it*.

In my second playthrough, I added *Paper Mâché Dream Balloon*, which brought similar vibes to *Oddments*. "Sense" was a strong start to the album, and the harmonica is great in "Dirt", "Paper Mâché Dream Balloon", "The Bitter Boogie", and "N.G.R.I (Bloodstain)". And the flute worked really well in "Bone" and "Paper Mâché". I can't say a single song stuck out as a favorite from this album, but the entire album mostly kept to a singular vibe that was similar to my favorite songs from *Oddments*.

And then we have the rest of the albums I listened to - which felt like the same album to me in a lot of ways. Part of that is that most of those albums had multiple songs that were really just one song split into parts. Take the start of *I'm in Your Mind Fuzz*, where "I'm in Your Mind", "I'm Not in Your Mind", "Cellophane", and "I'm in Your Mind Fuzz" are really just one long song. There is so much to love on these albums, and also so much that baffled me. Thankfully, the good outweighed the bad overall.

Let's start with the bad. No one will ever accuse this band of hiding the names of their songs in the lyrics. You want to know the name of "Cellophane", "Hot Water", "Wah Wah", "Road Train", "Rattlesnake", or "Crumbling Castle"? Don't worry, they will repeat that name 40 times in the song. In fact, for "Rattlesnake" and "Hot Water", the lyrics are almost entirely just the name of the song. Beyond that - even when the lyrics weren't super repetitive - either the 1) lyrics were nonsense, and/or 2) the vocals were so overpowered by the music that the lead vocals felt like background vocals.

And yet, I still liked a lot on these albums. The music was routinely great. "Am I in Heaven" was psychedelic and engaging. "Slow Jam 1" and "Her and I (Slow Jam 2)" were cohesive, slower paced songs with great moods. "Robot Stop"/"Big Fig Wasp"/"Gamma Knife" were instrumental powerhouses, featuring great guitar/bass/drums combos - and the harmonica is awesome. The keyboard stars in a few songs, like "Hot Water", "Mr. Beat", "Evil Death Roll", "Melting", "Nuclear Fusion", and "The Castle in the Air". "I'm in Your Mind" had a great intro, and the guitar transition into "I'm Not in Your Mind" was awesome; "Sleep Drifter", "Nuclear Fusion", "Deserted Dunes Welcome Weary Feet", and "Horology" also had great intros, with most of those doing my favorite *start with one instrument and then slowly add in the others* trick.

The point of all this - I loved the music, sometimes in spite of the vocals. This dichotomy, though, made it very hard to come up with a favorite album or song. With that said...

* Favorite album: For as much as I really liked the music on most of the later albums I listened to, *Oddments* was the most cohesive album for me, and the only album that led me to add something else in my second playthrough. The album had a higher concentration of songs where the vocals felt like an equal part of the song to the music, which I appreciated.
* Favorite song: I thought this was going to be "Work This Time" for most of the week. The vocals work with the music, and the laid-back guitar feels great. And yet, I keep coming back to "Open Water". The lyrics aren't noteworthy. The vocals are overpowered most of the way - but during the fourth minute they work well with the music. But the music is a force. The guitar is fantastic throughout. The drums are awesome. I get sucked in by the music, and just want to keep listening to it.

While listening to *12 Bar Bruise*, I wondered whether I was listening to a band that was having fun getting started, or if this was what their entire discography was like. And after listening to seven of the thirty (30!) albums that they've released since 2011, I'm left feeling like I might need to listen to the other twenty-three to fully answer that. And I'm slightly intrigued by that idea - there was enough to like and be intrigued by that part of me wonders what I would find in those albums. Perhaps they'd finally put together a song where everything worked for me through multiple listens. Maybe there would be an album I'd lose myself in. And yet, there was enough missing for me that I don't feel drawn to do so.

And yet, part of me does feel like I know where King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard fit into my life - because of [SchwarZenatoR](https://schwarzenator.bandcamp.com/music). I happened on this "band" about 15 years ago, a co-worker left it on a shared drive. This is a parody band, where every song is about an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. Are the songs amazing? No. Are the lyrics ridiculous? Yes. Is the music really good? YES. For years, their music was always part of my running mix - because when a song would come on, it would feel a jolt of energy. If nothing else, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard feels like they would fit this mold. So maybe I'll toss an album on while exercising some day, who knows 🤷

Next up, an artist I've been meaning to listen to for the past several years, but just haven't gotten to yet - Portugal. The Man
