I did more research this week than with any of the previous artists I've listened to. But that research didn't happen in advance - it happened halfway through my first run-through of this week's playlist:

* *Ray Charles* (1957)
* *The Genius of Ray Charles* (1959)
* "Georgia On My Mind"
* "Hit the Road Jack"
* *What'd I Say* (1959) - *second listen through only*
* *The Genius Sings the Blues*
* *Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, Vol 1 & 2*

Immediately I was brought back to being a 10-14 year old, mowing lawns. Which makes no sense out of context - but for me, until I got a CD player, I would repeatedly listen to the [Shell Cruisin' Classics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruisin'_Classics) cassettes. I sang along to Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis, ~Marvin~ Chuck Berry, The Temptations, and others for hour upon hour every summer for years. The tapes with music from the 50's through the 70's were my favorites. And Ray took me back to those right away.

*Ray Charles* really worked for me - ranging from "Sinner's Prayer" and its amazing depth to the romp that is "Mess Around" (the official song of Winston and CeCe, I assume), I was down with the entire album. That continued through *The Genius of Ray Charles* and both singles. But a big question kept creeping up to the front of my mind - why are so many of Ray's songs covers? I knew several of the songs on these albums, just not Ray's version - and I knew he wasn't the original performer. So it started to make me wonder why it is that Ray is so revered as an artist, when he was often playing someone else's song. Yes, I know he's a phenomenal piano player, and I love his voice; and yet I still felt like I must be missing something. As I continued listening, though, part of the answer came to me: after hearing Ray's version of these songs, I ended up liking his version more than the other versions I knew.

When I hit *The Genius Sings the Blues*, I felt like there was less I was missing, though. I felt even more of the emotion, more of the depth of his songs, and what it evoked in me. "I'm Movin' On" immediately jumped to the top of my list of his songs, it grabbed me completely.

And then I came to both volumes of *Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music*. These albums did not work for me the first time around. I was so confused - these songs neither sounded like Country and Western music to me, nor did they harken back to what I loved so much in previous albums. There were still standouts, like "I Can't Stop Loving You" and "Makes No Difference", but overall, this album fell flat for me at best, and at worst made me feel like I was listening to the closing credits of a 60+ year old movie like *Seven Brides for Seven Brothers* or an older Disney film. I just didn't get it.

And then I started my research.

Turns out, *Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music* is considered one of the greatest albums of all time. I was shocked - I didn't understand it, because I felt like I had just listened to three albums of his that I enjoyed *far* more than this album. I was so confused. But as I kept reading, things made more sense. I didn't realize the purpose of the album - to transform popular country and western songs into new song forms, like jazz, R&B, and pop. With this, the album finally made sense.

As I kept researching, I learned that Ray is held in such high esteem because of how he transformed music - his version of songs became the definitive version of songs (I didn't realize "Georgia on My Mind" wasn't "his song" until I read it this week). And since it was common practice at the time to sing standards, what Ray was doing wasn't far from out of the norm (I guess that's why they are called standards!). Armed with this new knowledge I was really looking forward to my second run-through of his music.

Everything I liked the first time around, I liked even more the second time. *Ray Charles* has so many levels, and every song seems to grab me in a different way - whether it made me dance in my seat or feel Ray's deep emotion, they all got me. Honestly, that continued for me through *The Genius of Ray Charles* and *What'd I Say*. I loved all of these albums, and every song stood out more. His version of "It Had to Be You" is easily my favorite now, and I can say the same for so many more of his songs. I felt like I "got it", finally.

And then I got to round two for *The Genius Sings the Blues*, and I got it even more. Ray Charles is "the anti-John Legend". What'd I say? Yeah, I said it. Here's the deal. John Legend has an amazing voice. I'd feel lucky if I could sing half as well as he can. He's very, very good. But what he doesn't do is make me feel things, and that might be because his voice is just *too* good. He's the Kevin Costner of singing - his troubled voice tone is the same as his happy voice tone, which is the same as his sad voice tone (much like Costner's happy/sad/angry faces are all also his confused face). Ray Charles, though, makes me feel **everything**. Every break in his voice, every little imperfection, just delivers that much more feeling into every lyric. *The Genius Sings the Blues* is truly an album that deserves to just be listened to while doing little-to-nothing else, and Ray really delivers. This album took me places both times through, even more so the second time.

And then I came back to *Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music*, and I did find myself getting it more. For every song I recognized, I knew I liked this version better. What I still didn't do, though, was outright love this album. It's not an album I see myself revisiting. But, I do appreciate it, and see the talent that created it, something I didn't get from just one listen.

And even with that said, give me all the rest of Ray's music that I listened to all day, he's great.

* Favorite song has been a rough question for me all week. Is it "Georgia on My Mind" or "Hit the Road Jack", songs that I've known for years that I have always really liked? Or new favorites like "Drown In My Own Tears", "Hallelujah, I Love Her So", or "I'm Movin' On"? Ask me again tomorrow, and I'll give you a different answer, but for today I can't help but fall back to "Hit the Road Jack"
* Favorite album was *Ray Charles* right up until my last listening of *The Genius Sings the Blues*. I don't think you can go wrong either way, and even typing this sentence I'm wavering.

Next week I move from an artist I didn’t realize I knew so little about to one I hadn’t even heard of before starting this project: PJ Harvey
