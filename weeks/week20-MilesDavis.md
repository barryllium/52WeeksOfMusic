Do... do I kinda like jazz now?

In a stunning reversal, after [John Coltrane](https://barrylliumlabs.com/music/post.html?file=week10-JohnColtrane.md) made me think I just did not like jazz, this week has managed to change my mind... at least a little bit. I know, it's [unbelievable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLr0v9MyGgM&t=75s). How, you ask? Well, let's look at the playlist.

* *‘Round About Midnight* (1957)
* *Milestones* (1958)
* *Kind of Blue* (1959)
* *Sketches of Spain* (1960) <small>second playthrough only</small>
* *Someday My Prince Will Come* (1961) <small>second playthrough only</small>
* *In a Silent Way* (1969)
* *Bitches Brew* (1970) <small>first playthrough only</small>

Right from the start of *‘Round About Midnight*, the titular track drew me in a bit. The bass really set the mood, and at one point I was thinking "this sax player is pretty good - I bet he could teach Coltrane a thing or two - I wonder who this is?". So I looked it up, and it was... John Coltrane 🤯. That's right, my old "friend" was back. And, as two different people said to me after reading my Coltrane review, I like Coltrane *infinitely* more when he plays with Miles Davis. I don't know if it's because Davis is doing the composing and reigns Coltrane in, or if I just like Davis's compositions better or what, but - and I'm gonna say something ground breaking here - that Coltrane guy is pretty damn good when he's not going all over creation with his improvisation.

The album overall was solid. There is some great piano work that I enjoyed in "Ah-Leu-Cha", especially when paired with the bass in the final third. Fitting that I enjoyed the trumpet even more, since this week is about Miles Davis. The rest of the album featured songs that had a few catchy moments, but outside of some piano work in "Tadd's Delight", nothing really stood out to me or "made me listen to it" as much as the first two songs.

And then *Milestones* starts off like a race, with the first minute or so of "Dr. Jekyll" being way too chaotic for me. I'm gonna blame Coltrane for that 😜. But the song mostly settles down, and we are again treated to some wonderful piano work later in the song. "Sid's Ahead", though, falls into a trap that was a constant theme this week. The 5-minute jazz song that lasts for 10-15 minutes. Maybe it's undiagnosed ADHD, or maybe jazz songs shouldn't be longer than 5-6 minutes, but this song starts with some fascinating trumpet playing to then go on for 11 more minutes, and somewhere in there (for reasons I just can't define), I just stopped caring.

"Sid's Ahead" isn't alone in that regard on this album, as "Straight, No Chaser" follows the "way too long approach" as well. Sure, the final third provided more enjoyable piano playing (as did much of "Billy Boy"), but overall, this album didn't quite live up to *‘Round About Midnight* for me. With that said, I did enjoy the moment that I realized that *Milestones* was a play on *Miles Tones* - so bonus points for you there, Miles Davis - you earned your [cool label](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siCNdfH9U40) with that alone.

And then we come to *Kind of Blue*. I don't know if this is the case, but I feel like this has to be the definitive Miles Davis album. Sure, some songs go on too long (perhaps "All Blues" should have only tried to cover "Some of the Blues"?), and some felt a bit repetitive. Overall, though, this album hits in a way that I didn't know jazz could hit for me. "So What" felt catchy, even if it does feel a bit repetitive near the end. "Freddie Freeloader" is solid and mostly kept my interest. "Flamenco Sketches" has great moments by both Davis and Coltrane on the trumpet and sax, and wonderful piano work throughout; plus the subdued nature of it flows beautifully. And then there is "Blue in Green". It has a very specific mood to it that I liked (that again, I can't define), and it doesn't overstay its welcome.

I'm going to lump *In a Silent Way* and *Bitches Brew* together, because these are the biggest offenders of the "what if we make a 20 minute jazz song" problem. In fact, for the first time in this project, I didn't listen to *Bitches Brew* a second time, because I decided I'd rather have that time back to check out more of his work.

That's not to say there aren't some good moments in these albums. "Pharaoh's Dance" goes back and forth for me - I'd like a few minutes, then get bored by repetition for a few minutes. "Spanish Key" starts out pretty well, and despite a lot going on, it mostly works, though I did find myself missing Coltrane during the sax parts. It does end with some nice guitar/piano work as well. Huge props to the song "John McLaughlin", which gets a small win for [one reason](https://youtu.be/eYegqmfq4ys?t=190s). And I must give credit where it's due, despite its length, "Miles Runs the Voodoo Down" kept my attention throughout the entire length of the song, despite some chaos around the 9 minute mark. It wins the award for "longest song that I kinda liked".

When listening to *In a Silent Way* for the second time, I started trying to imagine that these 20 minute long songs were really four 5 minute long songs - and in a few ways that worked. "Shhh / Peaceful" has a good "first song" to it, but overall felt like it was building to something that it never actually gets to. In my second listen, I realized that it's teasing me with the [Shaft theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxuiH6fVXAM) the entire time. I really liked the start of "In a Silent Way" (what I think of as song 1 of this track), and it has a great transition to "song 2". But, despite some solid work by [Herbie Hancock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G3wsusVkUM) on the electric piano, for how strongly the song starts, it fades out just as much as the song goes on.

In my second playthrough, I added *Sketches of Spain* and *Someday My Prince Will Come*. I can't think of a week since [boygenius](https://barrylliumlabs.com/music/post.html?file=week13-boygenius.md) where this paid off as well. *Sketches of Spain* was ok ("Solea" was easily my favorite song on the album despite some chaotic moments), but *Someday My Prince Will Come* was one of my favorite albums of the week. It had a leg up, because I am familiar with the song "Someday My Prince Will Come"; even without that, though, the trumpet, piano, and sax playing on the song all sounded great to me. And I *really* liked the simplicity, mood, and flow of "Old Folks" - I liked it even more than the title track, actually. "I Thought About You" drew me in with its tone throughout, and the rest of the songs on the album - while not spectacular - were solid and worth the listen.

Quite a journey this week, especially juxtaposed with my first foray into jazz ten weeks ago. I feel like Miles Davis provided some justice for John Coltrane, and gave me some albums that - while I might not seek them out - I would happily listen to again.

* Favorite Album: While *Someday My Prince Will Come* gave it a run for its money, this goes to *Kind of Blue*. It had two of my favorite songs of the week, and overall "made me listen to it" more than any of the other albums.
* Favorite Song: Speaking of my favorite songs from that album, this goes to "Blue in Green". I'd like to pretend this was a hard choice, but this song feels like what jazz should be. It knows what it is, it sets a mood, and it does its thing - then doesn't get repetitive or linger on. I legit enjoyed this song.

And now, after revisiting jazz, next week I hit one of those artists that I honestly wonder how I really don't know a ton about, despite being so strongly in the zeitgeist: The Rolling Stones.
